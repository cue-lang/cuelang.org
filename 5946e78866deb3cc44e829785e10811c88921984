      "message": "Honestly, I think that the lightest \"how do I get started with this experiment\" example is to show a short example of both old and new syntax. Essentially everyone interested in this experiment will be familiar with the old syntax and no-one will be familiar with the new. Showing the correspondence between the old and new forms is the fastest \"at a glance\" intro to the feature, even if it\u0027s just in some comments in file.cue. \n\nI don\u0027t think that a concept guide would be the right place for that (we should orient the concept guide to explaining the feature as-is rather than in terms of some previous version), and moving it to an FAQ seems unnecessary when we\u0027ve got a document that specifically oriented towards explaining it as an experiment, which by definition is applied with respect to some non-experimental base.\n\nIf we were to have an FAQ entry, it could point to this document (probably the first place that someone interested will look) rather than the other way around.\n\nAt a minimum, I think there should be old/new examples of what I believe are by far the most common current patterns for using aliases, to give an identifier to a field that doesn\u0027t have an identifier-compatible name, and to bring map keys into struct members.\n```\n// old form\nx\u003d\"foo bar\": 42\ny: x\n\nfoo: [n\u003dstring]: {\n\tname: n\n}\n```\n\n```\n// new form\n\n\"foo bar\"~x: 42\ny:           x\n\nfoo: [string]~(n,_): {\n\tname: n\n}\n```\n\nNeither of these common patterns appear as such in this doc page currently.",
