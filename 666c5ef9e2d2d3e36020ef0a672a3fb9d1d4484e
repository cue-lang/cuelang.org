      "message": "I don\u0027t have a direct wall-clock runtime comparison (as I\u0027m not running it against current tip again unless there\u0027s a dire emergency and/or I need to cook an egg on my laptop!), but running with this patchset does feel like a significant improvement.\n\nI noticed my system load seemed to be under 100, unlike my previous experience, at cue-lang/cue#3014, where the load of 254 was untenable. A simplistic check of `ps|grep docker` in a loop recorded a peak of 620 invocations. That doesn\u0027t necessarily correlate with 620 active containers (and I\u0027d expect a load above 100 if it did), but it compares positively with the 743 noticed in cue-lang/cue#3014.",
