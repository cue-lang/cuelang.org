      "message": "@rogpeppe@gmail.com - might I suggest it could be easier for you to take over this CL to get it into shape? Reason being, we now better understand the (current) limitations of `matchN` and getting the wording around that right is probably easiest if you give it a stab first. I also think we can probably reduce down to a single, commented code file of examples? But I defer on the readability of that point.",
