I think we should be adopting plainer language in terms of what we are doing. \n\nFor example, it contains the detail/caveat \"one-time\", \"pre-existing\" (which is arguably superfluous), \"related process\", \"exporting\" (which is relatively CUE-specific), \"into the Yaml form that GitHub actions requires\".... it\u0027s quite alot. \n\nHow about something like:\n\n\u003e This guide explains how to convert GitHub Actions workflow files from Yaml to CUE, check those workflows are valid, and then use the tooling layer to regenerate Yaml. This allows you to switch to CUE as a source of truth for GitHub Actions workflows and perform client-side validation, without GitHub needing to know that you are managing your workflows with CUE.",
