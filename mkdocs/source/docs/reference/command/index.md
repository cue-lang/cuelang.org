The `cue` command is a versatile interface for working with CUE and its ecosystem.
It provides a variety of sub-commands, including tools
for [validating]({{<relref"cue-help-vet">}}),
[importing]({{<relref"cue-help-import">}}), and
[exporting]({{<relref"cue-export">}}) data and constraints;
for creating
[data-driven workflows]({{<relref"cue-help-commands">}});
and for working with dependencies via
[CUE modules]({{<relref"cue-help-modules">}}) and
[module registries]({{<relref"cue-help-registryconfig">}}).

On this page you can find [the full list of sub-commands](#help-texts)
in the latest version of `cue`, and their built-in help texts.
You'll also find an incomplete-but-expanding set of guides dedicated to
[the most commonly-used sub-commands](#guides).
These guides include curated links to related content, including how-to guides,
tutorials and other relevant documentation.
