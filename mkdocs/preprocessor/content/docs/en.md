CUE supports and simplifies a wide variety of applications, such as
[data validation]({{< relref "docs/concept/how-cue-enables-data-validation" >}}),
[configuration]({{< relref "docs/concept/how-cue-enables-configuration" >}}),
[querying]({{< relref "docs/concept/querying-use-case" >}}),
and [code generation]({{< relref "docs/concept/code-generation-and-extraction-use-case" >}}),
with its underlying inference engine enabling data validation in code, and
flexible generation pipelines.
