This [Commented CUE]({{< relref "docs/howto/about-commented-cue-guides" >}})
demonstrates how to make sure that a list of concrete, simple values only
contains elements that are *also* present in another list.
In other words, how to ensure that one list is a "subset" of another list (even
though a list isn't a set, strictly speaking).

package example

_X: ["a", "b", "c"]

A: ["a", "a", "b", "a"]
// A must contain only values in _X.
A: [...or(_X)]

B: ["a", "b", "b", "E"]
// B must be a subset of _X.
B: [...or(_X)]

This guide shows some lists of concrete and simple values being validated against another list.

The technique it demonstrates can also be used to validate incomplete
(non-concrete) and composite (struct and list) values, but the rules around its
use are nuanced and evolving.

{{<issue 2583>}}Issue #2583{{</issue>}} tracks some open questions about
comparability in CUE that are worth considering before using this technique
to validate more complex values.
