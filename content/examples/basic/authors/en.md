In order to add authors to the articles, they need to be set up. This is done by
creating them in the `content > authors` folder. For each other, a new folder
is created. The name of this folder is the same as the name you use to add the
author to the frontmatter. Within this map, you add the markdown file with
the needed frontmatter and the author image you want to use for this author.

## Frontmatter

The following frontmatter is used for now. All are optional, but for the most
optimal results, all are filled in. Only the images have a fallback image.
