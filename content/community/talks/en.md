## 2025

- **The CUE registry: Versioning Now and Beyond**\
  [
    *CfgMgmtCamp Ghent, February 2025*
    | [*Synopsis*](https://cfp.cfgmgmtcamp.org/ghent2025/talk/BV3Y8M/)
  ]\
  We show how the CUE registry allows reproducible sharing of configuration and
  how this registry serves as a platform for unified configuration management

## 2023

- **Getting the Most out of your Policies with CUE**\
  [ *Open Core Summit, San Francisco, December 2023*
    | [*Video*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K--jCAe91PE)
  ]\
  Policy enforcement has been increasingly used to manage admission control,
  address security concerns, as well as a myriad of other applications.
  Policies typically contain information that is useful beyond the enforcement
  infrastructure and could be used, for instance, to prevent outages or improve
  documentation. But the typical siloed nature of such systems prevents such
  information from being used for these purposes. CUE takes a different angle
  to policy definitions that breaks these silos. We demonstrate several use
  cases by means of an example system.

- **Go \<\< CUE: Shifting Go left with CUE**\
  [ *GoLab Conference, Florence, November 2023*
    | [*Video*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5cEXqa4ZOI)
  ]\
  Where does your Go run? How do you tell it what to do? Configuration is a
  huge part of modern development but while we benefit from Go's static type
  system to catch programming errors early, we don't have the same for
  configuration data. This talk explains how the new CUE language integrates
  with Go, "shifting left" your Go types to earlier stages of deployment,
  reducing risk while bringing joy
  -- *Roger Peppe*

- **CUE + Terraform**\
  [ *Online, June 2023*
    | [*Video*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT7XcRqekNw)
    | [*Synopsis*](https://github.com/cue-lang/cue/discussions/2462)
  ]\
  The CUE project has been experimenting using CUE to drive Terraform to
  configure our GitHub organisations and repositories. Jonathan and Paul will
  share progress from this experiment, beginning with a demo of the running
  system and followed by Q&A
  -- *Paul Jolly and Jonathan Matthews*

- **CUE: A Type System for the Cloud**\
  [ *Craft Conference, Budapest, May 2023*
    | [*Video*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgNuOjSZL9Y)
  ]\
  CUE has an uncanny ability to act as an ad-hoc type checker that keeps things
  in check between loosely-coupled arbitrary systems that independently produce
  and consume data without knowing about each other. In this session we'll do a
  full tour of CUE, its syntax, semantics, and features. Aram will show you how
  you can use CUE to increase your confidence in your systems while
  simultaneously increasing development velocity
  -- *Aram Hăvărneanu*

- **CUE: A glimpse into the future of configuration engineering**\
  [
    *CfgMgmtCamp Ghent, February 2023*
    | [*Video*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOZPOusz4uo)
    | [*Synopsis*](https://cfp.cfgmgmtcamp.org/2023/talk/TUEMHQ/)

  Configuration has become the number one complexity problem to solve. Every
  part of your tech stack -- databases, apps, schemas, services, workflows,
  policy, models, networking -- must be configured. We show how CUE can help
  unify these silos

## 2022

- **Taming Configuration Complexity Made Fun With CUE**\
  [ *QCon Plus, San Francisco, December 2022*
    | [*Video+Synopsis*](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/cue-configuration/)
  ]\
  Marcel van Lohuizen discusses configuration at scale including the design of
  CUE, how configuration can go wrong, the need for testing and validation, and
  how CUE does holistic configuration
  -- *Marcel van Lohuizen*

- **A Practical Guide To CUE: Patterns For Everyday Use**\
  [ *FOSDEM 2022, Online, May 2022*
    | [*Video*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4v1_2bSeGI)
    | [*Synopsis*](https://archive.fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/cue_pratical_guide/)
  ]\
  In this talk, Marcel van Lohuizen and Paul Jolly start with a quick overview
  of CUE the language, then move on to present practical examples of CUE in
  action, including common patterns for validation, policy, integration with
  existing non-CUE configuration and more. Because CUE is new, established
  patterns are still in the making, but at the very least it will be a
  reflection of the current thinking
  -- *Marcel van Lohuizen and Paul Jolly*

- **Pulumi YAML and the CUE language**\
  [ *PulumiTV, Online, May 2022*
    | [*Video*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9NWBp_OjMo)

  Join us for this live Modern Infrastructure as David Flanagan and Paul Jolly
  show you how to use CUElang to describe your cloud infrastructure for Pulumi

## 2021

- **Using CUE with GitHub Actions**\
  [ *Online, December 2021*
    | [*Video*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey3ca0K2h2U)
  ]\
  Paul Jolly welcomes guest Michael Gasch to demonstrate how to use CUE with
  GitHub Actions. We demonstrate how to set up your project to configure GitHub
  Actions with CUE, and avoid writing a single line of YAML!
  -- *Paul Jolly*

- **Large-Scale Engineering of Configuration with Unification**\
  [ *Splash 2021: Conflang, November 2021*
    | [*Video*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSRXobu1jHk)
  ]\
  In this talk we introduce CUE: a new aspect-oriented, constraint-based
  configuration language that deploys a more formal approach to configuration
  aimed at solving many of the issues that persist with more conventional
  approaches. You will leave with an understanding of the CUE language, and an
  appreciation of how it can help mitigate the challenges associated with
  large-scale configurations.

## 2020

- **Better APIs with Shareable Validation Logic**\
  [ *GopherCon Europe, Online, July 2020*
    | [*Video*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRNluM2B4p8)
  ]\
  Validating data at various points, like in clients and servers, is desirable.
  But keeping validation logic in sync between, say,  Go code and OpenAPI is
  prone to errors and toil. CUE addresses this issue with the ability to
  convert and combine various formats. This allows for some cool and exciting
  rewriting capabilities, such as generating a single documented OpenAPI spec
  from various sources and automated compatibility checks. It addresses the
  issue that validation logic can often not be consolidated into one place or
  format
  -- *Marcel van Lohuizen*

## 2019

- **CUE: A Data Constraint Language and shoo-in for Go**\
  [ *GopherCon Russia, 2019*
    | [*Video*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3fhA12KS48)
  ]\
  A configuration language needs to balance compactness with complexity. Most
  languages end up being too complex for the value they provide. We show that
  inheritance is the culprit and provide an alternative: constraints. CUE's
  constraints describe configurations more compactly while at the same time
  validating them. As a separate thread throughout the talk, I'll explain how
  the idea for CUE was conceived, and why it wasn't implemented before
