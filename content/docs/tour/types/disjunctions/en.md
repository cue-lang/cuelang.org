title: Disjunctions
weight: 100
---

A **disjunction**, or sum type,
defines a constraint consisting of two or more options that are allowed.

The disjunction's options are values called its *elements*.
They are written separated by the pipe symbol (`|`).

A disjunction allows values
that unify successfully with *at least one* of its elements.
When a value constrained by a disjunction is exported
it must unify successfully with *only one* of the disjunction's elements.
<!-- TODO: should we relax or refine this wording,
given that `x: 1 & ( 1 | int )` exports successfully? -->
