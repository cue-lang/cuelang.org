title: '"Raw" Strings'

CUE doesn't strictly support raw strings.
Instead, the default escape delimiter (`\`) can be modified for a specific string.

Any given string's delimiter can be modified to add
an arbitrary number of trailing hash symbols to the default delimiter.\
The delimiter is changed by
*surrounding* the string with the required number of hash symbols: `#"string value"#`.

Both normal and multi-line strings allow their delimeters to be modified in this way.
The change affects all types of escape, including Unicode code points and interpolations.
Changing a string's escape delimiter is particularly useful when encoding
strings containing quotes or backslashes, as neither character needs to be
escaped in such strings.
