title: Default Values
weight: 110
---

Elements of a disjunction may be prefixed with the preference marker (`*`).

If there is only one mark,
or if unfication constrains a field sufficiently so that only one mark remains,
then that value is the default value.

CUE will select and use the default value when a concrete value is required
but none has been explicitly specified.

{{{with code "en" "defaults"}}}
exec cue eval file.cue
cmp stdout out
-- file.cue --
a: int | *1 // a single default is selected.

// b's two defaults are incompatible, so neither
// is selected.
b: *2 | 99
b: *99 | 2

// c's three defaults are incompatible, but two
// of them are excluded by the final disjunction
// so the only remaining default is selected.
c: *1 | 2 | 3 | 4
c: 1 | *2 | 3 | 4
