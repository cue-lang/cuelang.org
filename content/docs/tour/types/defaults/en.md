title: Default Values
weight: 110

**Default values** allow CUE to decide which element of a disjunction should be
chosen when a configuration doesn't specify a value, leaving more than one of
the disjunction's elements as valid options.

A default value is an element in a disjunction that has been prefixed with the
preference marker `*`.

CUE will select and use the default when a value is required but none has been
explicitly specified.
