title: Top / Any
weight: 25
---

**Top**, written `_`, represents any CUE value.\
It can be thought of as a placeholder,
waiting to be given a more specific value elsewhere.

A field with a value of top can't be exported
because data formats such as JSON and YAML
don't have any way to represent non-concrete values.

Constraining a regular field with top brings that field into existence,
whilst allowing its value to be constrained and defined elsewhere.
