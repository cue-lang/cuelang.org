title: Templates
weight: 160
---

**Templating** is a highly effective way to reduce boilerplate
by specifying optional fields in bulk.
It allows the specification of constraints, or **templates**,
which are unified with every field of a struct that matches a given pattern.

A template's pattern is an expression in square brackets that selects which
fields will be constrained.
Each combination of the pattern and a constraint that it applies is called a
[**pattern constraint**]({{< relref "docs/tour/basics/folding-structs" >}}).
Currently, patterns must either be instances of `string`, or must be `_`.

Including an alias in the pattern's square brackets makes the label of each
matched field available inside the template.
