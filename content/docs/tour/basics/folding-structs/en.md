title: Folding of Single-Field Structs
weight: 240
---

In JSON, one defines nested values one value at a time.
Another way to look at this is that a JSON configuration is a set of
path-value pairs.

In CUE one defines a set of paths of which to apply
a concrete value or constraint all at once.
Because of CUE's order independence, values get merged

This example shows some path-value pairs, as well as
a constraint that is applied to those to validate them.
<!--
This also gives a handy shorthand for writing structs with single
members.

exec cue export fold.cue

// path-value pairs

outer: middle2: inner: 7

// collection-constraint pair
