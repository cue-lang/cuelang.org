title: Emitting Values
weight: 40
---

By default all top-level fields are emitted when evaluating a configuration.
**Embedding** a value at the top-level causes that value to be emitted instead.

The ability to emit values allows CUE configurations to define any top-level
type alongside any data required by the top-level value.
This surpasses JSON's ability to encode top-level scalars and arrays, whilst
keeping CUE optimised for its most common use case: defining structs.
