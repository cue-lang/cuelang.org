It provides a variety of sub-commands, including tools for
[validating]({{<relref"cue-help-vet">}}),
[exporting]({{<relref"cue-export">}}), and
[importing]({{<relref"cue-help-import">}})
data and constraints, and information for working with
[CUE modules]({{<relref"cue-help-modules">}}) and
[module registries]({{<relref"cue-help-registryconfig">}}).
