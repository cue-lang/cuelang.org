												Modules are how CUE publishes packages and manages dependencies.

												A module is a collection of packages that are released, versioned, and
												distributed together. Modules are downloaded from OCI-compliant
												artifact registries.

												The Central Registry for CUE modules (registry.cue.works) is
												used as the source for external modules by default.

												For a detailed reference on modules:

												\thttps://cuelang.org/docs/reference/modules/

												For information on commands that interact with modules:

												\tcue help mod

												For tutorials on how to use the Central Registry, see:

												\thttps://cuelang.org/docs/tutorial/working-with-the-central-registry/
												\thttps://cuelang.org/docs/tutorial/publishing-modules-to-the-central-registry/

												For a tutorial on how to work with a custom OCI registry for CUE modules:

												\thttps://cuelang.org/docs/tutorial/working-with-a-custom-module-registry/

												For information on how to specify the CUE registry:

												\tcue help registryconfig
