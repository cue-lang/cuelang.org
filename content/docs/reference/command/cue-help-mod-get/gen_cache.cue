												Get updates module dependencies, fetching new dependencies if
												needed and changing versions to specified versions. It can downgrade
												a version only when a higher version is not required by other
												dependencies.

												Each argument specifies a module path and optionally a version
												suffix. If there is no version suffix, the latest non-prerelease version
												of the module will be requested; alternatively a suffix of "@latest"
												also specifies the latest version.

												A version suffix can contain a major version only (@v1), a major and minor
												version (@v1.2) or full version (@v1.2.3). If minor or patch version is omitted, the
												latest non-prerelease version will be chosen that has the same major
												and minor versions.

												If the desired version cannot be chosen (for example because a
												dependency already uses a later version than the desired version),
												this command will fail.

												See "cue help environment" for details on how $CUE_REGISTRY is used to
												determine the modules registry.

												Usage:
												  cue mod get [flags]

												Global Flags:
												  -E, --all-errors     print all available errors
												  -C, --chdir string   change working directory before running command (must be the first flag)
												  -i, --ignore         proceed in the presence of errors
												  -s, --simplify       simplify output
