												cmd executes the named command for each of the named instances.

												Commands define actions on instances. For example, they may
												specify how to upload a configuration to Kubernetes. Commands are
												defined directly in tool files, which are regular CUE files
												within the same package with a filename ending in _tool.cue.
												These are typically defined at the module root so that they apply
												to all instances.

												Each command consists of one or more tasks. A task may, for
												example, load or write a file, consult a user on the command
												line, fetch a web page, and so on. Each task has inputs and
												outputs. Outputs are typically filled out by the task
												implementation as the task completes.

												Inputs of tasks my refer to outputs of other tasks. The cue tool
												does a static analysis of the configuration and only starts tasks
												that are fully specified. Upon completion of each task, cue
												rewrites the instance, filling in the completed task, and
												reevaluates which other tasks can now start, and so on until all
												tasks have completed.

												Available tasks can be found in the package documentation at

												\thttps://pkg.go.dev/cuelang.org/go/pkg/tool?tab=subdirectories

												Examples:

												In this simple example, we define a command called "hello",
												which declares a single task called "print" which uses
												"tool/exec.Run" to execute a shell command that echos output to
												the terminal:

												\t$ cat <<EOF > hello_tool.cue
												\tpackage foo

												\timport "tool/exec"

												\tcity: "Amsterdam"
												\twho: *"World" | string @tag(who)

												\t// Say hello!
												\tcommand: hello: {
												\t\tprint: exec.Run & {
												\t\t\tcmd: "echo Hello \\(who)! Welcome to \\(city)."
												\t\t}
												\t}
												\tEOF

												We run the "hello" command like this:

												\t$ cue cmd hello
												\tHello World! Welcome to Amsterdam.

												\t$ cue cmd --inject who=Jan hello
												\tHello Jan! Welcome to Amsterdam.


												In this example we declare the "prompted" command which has four
												tasks. The first task prompts the user for a string input. The
												second task depends on the first, and echos the response back to
												the user with a friendly message. The third task pipes the output
												from the second to a file. The fourth task pipes the output from
												the second to standard output (i.e. it echos it again).

												\tpackage foo

												\timport (
												\t\t"tool/cli"
												\t\t"tool/exec"
												\t\t"tool/file"
												\t)

												\tcity: "Amsterdam"

												\t// Say hello!
												\tcommand: prompter: {
												\t\t// save transcript to this file
												\t\tvar: file: *"out.txt" | string @tag(file)

												\t\task: cli.Ask & {
												\t\t\tprompt:   "What is your name?"
												\t\t\tresponse: string
												\t\t}

												\t\t// starts after ask
												\t\techo: exec.Run & {
												\t\t\tcmd:    ["echo", "Hello", ask.response + "!"]
												\t\t\tstdout: string // capture stdout
												\t\t}

												\t\t// starts after echo
												\t\tappend: file.Append & {
												\t\t\tfilename: var.file
												\t\t\tcontents: echo.stdout
												\t\t}

												\t\t// also starts after echo
												\t\tprint: cli.Print & {
												\t\t\ttext: echo.stdout
												\t\t}
												\t}

												Run "cue help commands" for more details on tasks and commands.
