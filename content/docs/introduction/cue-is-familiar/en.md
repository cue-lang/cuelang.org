title: A Familiar Look and Feel

CUE will probably feel rather familiar if you've spent any time working with
data. CUE shares some syntax with JSON, but **significantly** improves the
experience of managing JSON by hand.

In its very simplest form, CUE looks a lot like JSON.
This is because CUE is a superset of JSON, which means that all valid JSON is
CUE - but *not* vice versa.
Managing JSON manually can be somewhat painful, so CUE introduces several
conveniences to make writing and reading data easier:

- comments are allowed, starting with `//` and extending to the end of the line
- field names without special characters donâ€™t need to be quoted
- the outermost curly braces in a CUE file are optional
- commas after a field are optional (and are usually omitted)
- commas after the final element of a list are allowed
- literal multiline strings are allowed, and don't require newlines to be encoded
- nested structs containing one (or a few) fields have a convenient shorthand

Here's some data encoded as commented CUE, alongside the equivalent JSON
document. Notice how the CUE lacks curly braces at the top and bottom, and
doesn't have commas after each field's value:

{{{with code "en" "CUE improves on JSON"}}}
#location left right
exec cue export example.cue --out json
cmp stdout out
-- example.cue --
strings: {
	singleLine: "Double quotes == string literal"
	multiLine: """
		Multiline strings start and end with triple
		double-quotes - no escaping of newlines!
		"""
}

// Many field names don't need to be quoted
// (but can be, if you want).
foo_Bar: 1
baz2:    2.2

// Some field names do need quotes, such as those
// that start with numbers, or contain spaces,
// hyphens, or other special characters.
"qu ux": "3.33"
"4":     "four"

a: deeply: nested: field: "value"

// A list's final element can be followed by
// an optional comma, making additions or
// deletions at the end of the list less fiddly.
aList: [
	"a",
	"b",
	"c",
]
anotherList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

{
    "strings": {
        "singleLine": "Double quotes == string literal",
        "multiLine": "Multiline strings start and end with triple\ndouble-quotes - no escaping of newlines!"
    },
    "foo_Bar": 1,
    "baz2": 2.2,
    "qu ux": "3.33",
    "4": "four",
    "a": {
        "deeply": {
            "nested": {
                "field": "value"
            }
        }
    },
    "aList": [
        "a",
        "b",
        "c"
    ],
    "anotherList": [
        1,
        2,
        3,
        4,
        5
    ]
}

However, most CUE users don't choose CUE simply because it's nicer to handle
than JSON - that's just a nice side effect of the language's design that makes
life easier. Folks adopt CUE because of its most revolutionary features,
which stem from the concepts and syntaxes it introduces that *won't* seem quite
as familiar.
