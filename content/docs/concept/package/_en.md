CUE packages are modular units that encapsulate CUE files and related resources, promoting code organization and reuse. A package typically includes:

- **CUE Definitions**: These define schemas, validation rules, and data models.
- **Imports**: Packages can import other CUE packages, enabling a hierarchical and composable approach to configuration.
- **Documentation**: Clear documentation helps users understand the purpose and usage of the package.

## Benefits of Using CUE Packages

1. **Modularity**: Break down complex configurations into manageable parts.
2. **Reusability**: Share and reuse packages across different projects or environments.
3. **Validation**: Ensure configurations adhere to defined schemas, reducing errors.
4. **Clarity**: Improve understanding through well-structured documentation.

By utilizing CUE packages, teams can enhance collaboration and maintain consistency across their configuration management efforts. Whether you’re working on cloud infrastructure, application settings, or any other configuration-heavy project, CUE packages provide the tools needed to streamline the process.
