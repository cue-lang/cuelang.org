The [v0.9.0](/releases/v0.9.0) release of CUE
made "new" modules the default ... but
what *are* "new" modules, and
what were "old" modules?
What's the difference between them, and
can we still use the "old" ones?

This guide answers those frequently-asked questions,
and includes extra information about CUE's transition from "old" to "new"
modules -- and how the transition affects your CUE.

## What do you mean by "old" and "new" modules?

The concept of a module has existed since the early days of CUE, but its
initial support for modules was very primitive.

Dependencies needed to be downloaded manually and then copied, by hand, into
the `cue.mod/{gen,pkg,usr}` directories. There was no native tooling for
fetching modules from a remote store, or for publishing them in the first
place. Native module support within the CUE toolchain and APIs was missing, and
everything was very minimal and extremely manual. We refer to this original
behaviour as the "old" modules implementation.

To address the shortcomings of the old modules implementation, we went through
a number of design and proposal iterations. These culminated in the
{{<issue 2939>}}modules proposal v3{{</issue>}}, which was accompanied by an
experimental implementation in pre-releases of the v0.8.x series from version
`v0.8.0-alpha.1` in February 2024. Old modules remained the default behaviour
at this time, but the experimental implementation could be enabled by setting
the environment variable `CUE_EXPERIMENT=modules`.

In May 2024, after extensive testing and feedback from users, the modules
proposal v3 was
[accepted](https://github.com/cue-lang/cue/discussions/2939#discussioncomment-9468945).
At this time we started referring to the experimental implementation that
supported the v3 proposal as "new" modules, to reflect the change away from it
being an experiment. The default behaviour was still that of old modules, with
"new" modules being enabled using the same `CUE_EXPERIMENT=modules` environment
variable as before.

At the start of June 2024 CUE v0.9.0 was released. It changed CUE's default
behaviour - new modules were now enabled out of the box.  This removed the need
to enable them manually, but folks needing old modules in CUE v0.9.x or v0.10.x
could set `CUE_EXPERIMENT=modules=0` to revert to the old behaviour.

The first pre-release for v0.11.0 dropped support for old modules: setting
`CUE_EXPERIMENT=modules=0` causes an error with all CUE versions starting from
`v0.11.0-alpha.1`.

## Modules? Where do I get started?

{{< linkto/inline "tutorial/working-with-the-central-registry" >}} and
{{< linkto/inline "tutorial/working-with-a-custom-module-registry" >}}
present an easy-to-digest introduction to modules.
The {{<tag modules>}} tag lists other modules-related content.
The {{< linkto/inline "reference/modules" >}} reference is the definitive
document that details how modules work.

## What is the Central Registry?

The Central Registry at [registry.cue.works](https://registry.cue.works/) is
currently in alpha testing, and will be a well-known place for schemas for
well-known services and projects. We will share more details about the Central
Registry in the future.
For now, we are looking to get early feedback - please come and discuss it in
the `#modules` channel [on Slack](/s/slack) or [on Discord](/s/discord).

## Why do I need to run `cue mod fix`?

v0.9.0 requires that `language.version` is declared in the `cue.mod/module.cue` file.
Running
[`cue mod fix`]({{< relref "docs/reference/command/cue-help-mod-fix" >}})
does this automatically for you. It also moves unrecognized top-level fields to
a `custom.legacy` field. If you already have a `language.version` field, then
`cue mod fix` is a no-op in this regard.

## Why is `language.version` now required?

With v0.9.0, CUE requires that a language version be declared in a `cue.mod/module.cue` file:

{{{with upload "en" "module.cue example"}}}
-- cue.mod/module.cue --
module: "mod.example/hello@v0"
language: version: "v0.9.0"
{{{end}}}

When running `cue mod init` to create a new module, this line is added
automatically. Where a `language.version` field is missing, CUE will error and
suggest that you use `cue mod fix` to add it.

This transition started with
[v0.8.0](https://github.com/cue-lang/cue/releases/tag/v0.8.0) when the field
was introduced and started being added by `cue mod init`.
By now requiring a language version, CUE is more closely following an approach
like Go when it comes to [forwards compatibility](https://go.dev/blog/toolchain).
This means that modules depending on any upcoming language changes or changes
in semantics can declare a minimum version of CUE required to evaluate that
code. Similarly, evaluating an older CUE module can be done with the knowledge
that it was written against an older version of the CUE language spec and
semantics.

See
[the Modules reference document]({{< relref "docs/reference/modules" >}}#cue-mod-file)
for an explanation of the various fields in a `cue.mod/module.cue` file.

## What about old modules that don't have a `language.version` field?

In some cases, the above suggestion to use `cue mod fix` to migrate the
`module.cue` file might not be possible. This might happen, for example, if you
are using the CUE Go API and need to interpret older CUE code. There is now an
`AcceptLegacyModules` field in the `cue/load.Config` struct that can direct the
loader to fix the main module's `module.cue` file automatically without the
need to change it on disk.

## Why do I need to specify a source to publish a module?

`cue mod publish` needs to determine what files to include in a published
module. Rather than rely on implicit heuristics such as whether a VCS exists or
is installed,to determine whether the file list should be determined from the
files on disk, or from the contents of a Git commit, we require the module
author to be explicit.

## How do I configure which OCI registry is used for publishing/fetching modules?

As explained by
[`cue help environment`]({{< relref "docs/reference/command/cue-help-environment" >}}),
the `CUE_REGISTRY` environment variable determines the configuration to use
when downloading and publishing modules. See
[`cue help registryconfig`]({{< relref "docs/reference/command/cue-help-registryconfig" >}})
for details.

## Where can I find out more about modules commands?

See [`cue help mod`]({{< relref "docs/reference/command/cue-help-mod" >}}).

## What about tag injection?

Tag injection remains similar in the new module implementation, with the
notable exception of `@if` attributes. Specifically:
- tags are injected only into packages explicitly mentioned on the command line
  or as explicit packages to
  [cue/load.Instances](https://pkg.go.dev/cuelang.org/go/cue/load#Instances).
  (This behavior has not changed from versions of CUE before v0.9)
- `@if` attributes only process tags when they are in files inside the main
  module. In any external module, all tags are considered to be `false`. This
  is a change from earlier versions, when there was no distinction between the
  main module and external modules.
<!-- TODO: @if(!foo) in an external module results in `!false == true`, so the file is included. Show this in an example. -->

## Can I use "`cue.mod/usr`" with new modules?

Technically, yes: you can. However, there's one very important caveat that you
need to be aware of: if a module dependency is declared in your
`cue.mod/module.cue` file (in the `deps` field), then packages from the module
that CUE needs to resolve **cannot exist in *any* of the
`cue.mod/{pkg,gen,usr}` directories**.  If you try to declare and define a
package in both "old" and "new" locations then an error will ocurr:

```
mod.example@v0: import failed: cannot find package "github.com/cue-labs/examples/frostyconfig@v0": ambiguous import: found package github.com/cue-labs/examples/frostyconfig@v0 in multiple modules:
        github.com/cue-labs/examples/frostyconfig@v0 v0.0.1 (.)
        local (cue.mod/usr/github.com/cue-labs/examples/frostyconfig):
```

Essentially, in this scenario, the CUE loader is unable to determine which
package definition "wins". Because of this, old and new modules are mutually
exclusive *at the individual package level*.

We continue to support `cue.mod/{pkg,gen,usr}` for now, as we continue our
efforts to improve the CUE module ecosystem.
In particular, we are looking to better understand how to support:

- generated CUE modules (old modules: `cue.mod/gen`); and
- user augmentations for dependencies/generated CUE modules (old modules:
  `cue.mod/usr`).

Work on the
[Central Registry](https://registry.cue.works/)
is a key part of these goals.
We welcome and encourage you to share your experiences and use cases for either
of these features in {{<issue 2865/>}}.
