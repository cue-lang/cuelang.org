# Welcome to CUE!

CUE is an open-source data validation language and inference engine
with its roots in logic programming.
Although the language is not a general-purpose programming language
it supports and simplifies a wide variety of applications, such as
[data validation]({{< relref "concept/data-validation-use-case" >}}),
[configuration]({{< relref "concept/how-cue-enables-configuration" >}}),
[querying]({{< relref "docs/concept/querying-use-case" >}}),
and [code generation]({{< relref "concept/code-generation-and-extraction-use-case" >}}).

<!-- TODO: add when content is expanded: -->
<!-- [scripting](TODO)       https://github.com/cue-lang/docs-and-content/issues/27 -->
<!-- [data templating](TODO) https://github.com/cue-lang/docs-and-content/issues/26 -->

The inference engine can be used to validate
data in code, or to include it as part of a code generation pipeline.
