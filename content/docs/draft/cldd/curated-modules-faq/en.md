The CUE [Central Registry](https://registry.cue.works)
provides some carefully selected and curated
[CUE modules]({{<relref"docs/concept/modules">}}) that you can use to
create validated configurations across a range of popular projects and
services, or to check that your existing configurations are valid.

Here are some common questions that folks have asked about curated modules.
Please do join [the CUE community]({{<relref"community">}}) and ask us anything
you think we've missed!

## What curated modules are available?

The curated modules currently published cover:
- [Kubernetes](#kubernetes)
- [GitHub Actions](#github-actions)
- [GitLab CI](#gitlab-ci)
- [Buildkite](#buildkite)
- [Azure Pipelines](#azure-pipelines)
- [Argo CD](#argo-cd)
- [Go Releaser](#go-releaser)
- [Docker Compose](#docker-compose)
- [npm's `package.json`](#npms-packagejson)

In the future, the search function of the Central Registry will be the easiest
way to discover suitable modules to use.

## Why are curated modules published in a temporary namespace?

Well spotted! The import paths you *currently* need to use for a curated module
include a `cue-tmp/jsonschema-pub/exp3` component.
This definitely looks a bit
"temporary" - which it is, but only while the proper namespace is being
decided.

At some point in the future the curated modules will be published in
their proper namespace. But you can rest easy, because one important property
of the
[Central Registry](https://registry.cue.works)
is that, once a schema is published, it will always be available at that
location. Your CUE can rely on the "temporary" paths mentioned on this page for
as long as you like. When the proper namespace is decided, you can then easily
use the
[`cue refactor imports`]({{<relref"docs/reference/command/cue-help-refactor-imports">}})
command to update your CUE.

## What do I need to use a curated module?

You'll need an account on the CUE
[Central Registry](https://registry.cue.works), and we also suggest
that you upgrade to
[the latest version]({{<relref"docs/introduction/installation">}})
of CUE so that you can switch to the new evaluator.
All curated modules are tested using `evalv3`, so its use is strongly recommended.
Many questions about `evalv3` are answered in
{{<linkto/inline"concept/faq/upgrading-from-evalv2-to-evalv3">}} -- and if you
have an unanswered question, please join
[the CUE community]({{<relref"community">}}) and ask for help!
