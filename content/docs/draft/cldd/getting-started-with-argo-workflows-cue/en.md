{{<info>}}
Curated modules are a work in progress and your feedback is important!
Please [report any issues]({{<report-issue-url>}}) you find.
{{</info>}}

The CUE
[Central Registry](https://registry.cue.works/)
provides a well-known location for well-known schemas, including those for
[YAML workflow files](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fields/)
used by [Argo Workflows](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

This guide shows you how to get started defining your Argo Workflows in CUE using
[curated modules]({{<relref"curated-modules-faq">}}).

## Login to the Central Registry

{{{with script "en" "cue login"}}}
#norun
cue login
{{{end}}}
The
[Central Registry](https://registry.cue.works)
requires authentication, so you need to login before you can use its schemas.

## Initialise your local CUE module

CUE that uses schemas and modules from the
[Central Registry](https://registry.cue.works)
needs to exist within its own CUE module.
{{{with script "en" "cue mod init"}}}
cue mod init cue.example
{{{end}}}
You can choose any module name you like - it's easy to
[change it later]({{<relref"docs/reference/command/cue-help-mod-rename">}}).
<<<<<<< HEAD
It makes sense for your CUE module to exist at the root of a git repository
that's hosted on GitHub, but the commands in this guide will work in any setup.

## Create a GitHub workflow

In later guides we'll add more workflows to the `workflow` struct, but this
initial `example` workflow comes from
[GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/use-cases-and-examples/creating-an-example-workflow#creating-an-example-workflow),
converted to CUE using
[`cue import`]({{<relref"docs/reference/command/cue-help-import">}}):

{{{end}}}
The `import` at the top references the appropriate curated module for the workflow.
Its path is currently temporary, but only while its proper location is being decided.
The temporary path isn't a problem because one important property of the
[Central Registry](https://registry.cue.works)
is that, once a schema is published, it will always be
available at that location.
When the curated moduleâ€™s location is finalised and versions are published
under the new path, you can use the
[`cue refactor imports`]({{<relref"docs/reference/command/cue-help-refactor-imports">}})
command to update your CUE easily, so it reflects the new location.

## Tidy your local CUE module

{{{with script "en" "tidy"}}}
cue mod tidy
{{{end}}}
Tidying a module is an important part of using curated modules from the
[Central Registry](https://registry.cue.works).
Always use
[`cue mod tidy`]({{<relref"docs/reference/command/cue-help-mod-tidy">}})
when you use a curated module for the first time.

## Validate your workflow

{{{with script "en" "vet"}}}
cue vet -c
{{{end}}}
Because `cue vet` doesn't display any errors, you know that the curated schema has validated your workflow.

## Export your workflow as YAML
<<<<<<< HEAD

Before exporting your workflow you'll need to create a directory to hold it, as expected by GitHub Actions:
{{{with script "en" "export"}}}
mkdir -p .github/workflows/
cue export --outfile .github/workflows/workflow.yml -e workflow.example
{{{end}}}
{{{with _script_ "en" "HIDDEN: move before diff"}}}
mv .github/workflows/workflow.yml{,.got}
=======
{{{with script "en" "export"}}}
cue export --outfile workflow.yml
{{{end}}}
{{{with _script_ "en" "HIDDEN: move"}}}
mv workflow.yml{,.got}
>>>>>>> bef5ccc8b (docs/draft/cldd: +getting-started-with-argo-workflows)
{{{end}}}

If you chose to export the `workflow.example` shown above,
your validated YAML workflow will look like this:
{{{with upload "en" "yaml"}}}
<<<<<<< HEAD
-- .github/workflows/workflow.yml --
name: learn-github-actions
run-name: ${{ github.actor }} is learning GitHub Actions
"on":
  - push
jobs:
  check-bats-version:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "20"
      - run: npm install -g bats
      - run: bats -v
{{{end}}}
{{{with _script_ "en" "HIDDEN: diff"}}}
diff --side .github/workflows/workflow.yml{,.got}
{{{end}}}

## Run your workflow

The `cue.mod` and `.github` directories need to be stored in your git
repository, along with your `workflow.cue` file.
After recording them in a commit you can push your branch to GitHub and trigger
the workflow.

Whenever you update your CUE workflow, re-run the `cue export` command shown
above, and then use `git` to record any changes to these files and directories.

{{{with script "en" "HIDDEN: diff"}}}

# diff .github/workflows/workflow.yml .workflow.yml
