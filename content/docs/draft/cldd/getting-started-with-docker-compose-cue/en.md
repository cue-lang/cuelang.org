The CUE
[Central Registry](https://registry.cue.works/)
provides a well-known location for well-known schemas, including those for
[compose files](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/main/spec.md#compose-file)
used by [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and
[podman-compose](https://github.com/containers/podman-compose).

This guide shows you how to get started defining your compose files in CUE using
[curated modules]({{<relref"curated-modules-faq">}}).

## Login to the Central Registry

{{{with script "en" "cue login"}}}
#norun
cue login
{{{end}}}
The
[Central Registry](https://registry.cue.works)
requires authentication, so you need to login before you can use its schemas.

## Initialise your local CUE module

CUE that uses schemas and modules from the
[Central Registry](https://registry.cue.works)
needs to exist within its own CUE module.
{{{with script "en" "cue mod init"}}}
cue mod init cue.example
{{{end}}}
You can choose any module name you like - it's easy to
[change it later](https://cuelang.org/docs/reference/command/cue-help-mod-rename/).
It makes sense for your CUE module to exist at the root of a source code
repository, but the commands in this guide will work in any setup.

## Create a compose file

Declare a compose file in CUE. This one is based on a PostgreSQL example from
[`docker/awesome-compose`](https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose/tree/18f59bdb09ecf520dd5758fbf90dec314baec545/postgresql-pgadmin):

{{{with upload "en" "1"}}}
-- compose.cue --
package dev

import "test.cue.works/x1/dockercompose"

files: example: dockercompose.#Schema & {
	services: {
		postgres: {
			container_name: "postgres"
			image:          "postgres:latest"
			environment: [
				"POSTGRES_USER=${POSTGRES_USER}",
				"POSTGRES_PASSWORD=${POSTGRES_PW}",
				"POSTGRES_DB=${POSTGRES_DB}",
			]
			ports: ["5432:5432"]
			restart: "always"
		}
		pgadmin: {
			container_name: "pgadmin"
			image:          "dpage/pgadmin4:latest"
			environment: [
				"PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL=${PGADMIN_MAIL}",
				"PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=${PGADMIN_PW}",
			]
			ports: ["5050:80"]
			restart: "always"
		}
	}
}
{{{end}}}

In later guides we'll add more entries to the `files` struct.

The `import` at the top references the appropriate curated module for the file.
Its path is currently temporary, but only while its proper location is being decided.
The temporary path isn't a problem because one important property of the
[Central Registry](https://registry.cue.works)
is that, once a schema is published, it will always be
available at that location.
When the curated moduleâ€™s location is finalised and versions are published
under the new path, you can use the
[`cue refactor imports`](https://cuelang.org/docs/reference/command/cue-help-refactor-imports/)
command to update your CUE easily, so it reflects the new location.

## Tidy your local CUE module

{{{with script "en" "tidy"}}}
cue mod tidy
{{{end}}}
Tidying a module is an important part of using curated modules from the
[Central Registry](https://registry.cue.works).
Always use
[`cue mod tidy`](https://cuelang.org/docs/reference/command/cue-help-mod-tidy/)
when you use a curated module for the first time.

## Validate your compose file

{{{with script "en" "vet"}}}
cue vet -c
{{{end}}}
Because `cue vet` doesn't display any errors, you know that the curated schema has validated your compose file.

## Export your compose file as YAML

{{{with script "en" "export"}}}
cue export --outfile compose.yaml -e files.example
{{{end}}}
{{{with _script_ "en" "HIDDEN: move before diff"}}}
mv compose.yaml{,.got}
{{{end}}}

If you chose to export the `files.example` shown above,
your validated YAML file will look like this:
{{{with upload "en" "yaml"}}}
-- compose.yaml --
services:
  postgres:
    container_name: postgres
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=${POSTGRES_USER}
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=${POSTGRES_PW}
      - POSTGRES_DB=${POSTGRES_DB}
    image: postgres:latest
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    restart: always
  pgadmin:
    container_name: pgadmin
    environment:
      - PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL=${PGADMIN_MAIL}
      - PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=${PGADMIN_PW}
    image: dpage/pgadmin4:latest
    ports:
      - "5050:80"
    restart: always
{{{end}}}
{{{with _script_ "en" "HIDDEN: diff"}}}
diff -u compose.yaml{,.got}
{{{end}}}

## Run your compose file

Start the compose-based services by using the `docker compose up` or `podman
compose up` commands. (This example requires
[a couple of environment variables](https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose/tree/18f59bdb09ecf520dd5758fbf90dec314baec545/postgresql-pgadmin#env)
to be specified beforehand.)

The `cue.mod` directory should be stored in your source code repository,
along with your `compose.cue` and `compose.yaml` files.
Whenever you update your CUE file, re-run the `cue export` command shown above,
and then record any changes to these files and directories.
