This guide demonstrates how to use the
[`cue mod mirror`]({{<relref"docs/reference/command/cue-help-mod-mirror">}})
command to copy
[CUE modules]({{<relref"docs/reference/modules">}})
between registries.

`cue mod mirror` can be used to mirror modules between any pair of registries for
which you have appropriate access permissions. The example shown here mirrors
modules from the CUE
[Central Registry](https://registry.cue.works)
to a local, in-memory registry. The contents of this local registry are
ephemeral: they disappear when it shuts down -- so don't use this registry to
store your important modules!

The `cue mod mirror` command is not yet available in the latest CUE release.
This guide demonstrates the following
[pre-release version]({{<relref"docs/introduction/installation/#download-an-official-cue-binary">}}):

{{{with script "en" "cue version"}}}
#ellipsis 1
cue version
{{{end}}}

{{{with step}}}
Start the in-memory registry running in the background, listening on localhost port `55443`:

{{{with script "en" "start local registry"}}}
#norun
cue mod registry 127.0.0.1:55443
{{{end}}}

Every module mirrored to this ephemeral registry will disappear when you stop it.
{{{end}}}

{{{with step}}}
Copy the `k8s.io` curated module from the Central Registry to the local registry:

{{{with script "en" "cue mod mirror"}}}
cue mod mirror --to 127.0.0.1:55443 github.com/cue-tmp/jsonschema-pub/exp3/k8s.io
{{{end}}}

The [`cue mod mirror`]({{<relref"docs/reference/command/cue-help-mod-mirror">}})
command copies each module from and to the appropriate registry for its
[module path]({{<relref"docs/reference/modules/#module-path">}}) --
which is usually the Central Registry, but can be configured differently (see
<code>{{<linkto/inline"reference/command/cue-help-registryconfig">}}</code>
for more information).
In this example we overrode the configured destination registry using the `--to` flag.
The `--from` flag can also be used to override the configured source registry.

By default, `cue mod mirror` copies the latest version of each module
specified, along with that version's dependencies and all their transitive
dependencies. This behaviour can be varied, as described by
<code>{{<linkto/inline"reference/command/cue-help-mod-mirror">}}</code>.
