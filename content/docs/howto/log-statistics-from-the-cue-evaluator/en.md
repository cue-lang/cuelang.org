The `cue` command can log various summary statistics about each evaluation it
performs, in order to assist with the diagnosis of performance-related and
other issues. The command logs statistics when the `CUE_STATS_FILE` environment
variable is set to a filename.

The filename is interpreted through the same rules that `cue export` applies to
its `--outfile` argument, which are explained in
[`cue filetypes`]({{< relref "docs/reference/cli/cue-filetypes" >}}).
Statistics for each evaluation are written into the named file using the file's
implied data format.
The file is overwritten on each `cue` invocation, without confirmation.

{{{with _upload_ "en" "file"}}}
-- someFile.cue --
x: 1, y: 2.2, z: "3.33" // This hidden file's contents aren't important.
{{{end}}}

{{{with script "en" "example"}}}
export CUE_STATS_FILE=stats.cue
cue vet someFile.cue
cat stats.cue
{{{end}}}

Specifying the filename `-` causes `cue` to log statistics to its standard error stream as JSON.
A different format may be selected using a qualifier prefix as outlined in
[`cue filetypes`]({{< relref "docs/reference/cli/cue-filetypes" >}}).
For example: to emit YAML, specify `yaml:-`.
