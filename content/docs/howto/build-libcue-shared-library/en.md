The library [`libcue`](https://github.com/cue-lang/libcue) provides a mechanism
to use CUE in C and C-like languages. This guide demonstrates how it can be
compiled as a shared library, which is a required step before using it with
languages such as Java.

{{<info>}}
`libcue` is an experimental technology preview.
The library is under development and is subject to change.

## Prerequisites

- **Go version 1.22 or later** with [`cgo`](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/cgo) enabled
  -- [installation details](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- **GCC or Clang** -- any version shipped with a relatively modern Linux or macOS will be sufficient
- **Git** -- [installation details](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Set up the build environment

{{{with step}}}
Enable [`cgo`](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/cgo):

{{{with script "en" "cgo"}}}
export CGO_ENABLED=1
{{{end}}}
{{{end}}}

{{{with step}}}
Check that the Go prerequisites are met:

{{{with script "en" "prereqs: go"}}}
go version
go env CGO_ENABLED
{{{end}}}

Check that other prerequisites are met:

{{{with script "en" "prereqs: etc"}}}
#ellipsis 1
cc --version
git --version
{{{end}}}
{{{end}}}

{{{with step}}}
Clone the `libcue` repository and change into its directory:

<!-- TODO(jcm): is the canonical upstream github or gerrithub? -->
{{{with script "en" "git clone"}}}
#ellipsis 0
git clone https://github.com/cue-lang/libcue libcue-source
cd libcue-source
{{{end}}}
{{{end}}}

{{{with step}}}
Select a specific commit to build:

{{{with script "en" "git checkout"}}}
#ellipsis 1
git checkout 1c861cc9cdc5584f5d26b0a7112aa2afee74d4cf
{{{end}}}
<!-- TODO(jcm): derive this commit id from the id stored in site.cue -->

`libcue` is not currently versioned, so this step uses a specific commit reference.
{{{end}}}

## Build the library

{{{with step}}}
Build `libcue` as a shared library:

{{{with script "en" "go build"}}}
#ellipsis 0
go build -buildmode=c-shared -o libcue.so
{{{end}}}

The value passed to the `-o` flag is the filename that will contain the compiled output.
This value will vary, depending on your operating system.

The value shown above (`libcue.so`) is appropriate for most Unix systems, such as Linux.
On macOS you should use `libcue.dylib`,
and Windows requires `cue.dll` (*without* a "lib" prefix).
{{{end}}}

## Store the shared library

{{{with step}}}

To use the shared library built in the previous step the compiler, the runtime
loader, and potentially the language runtime will need to know the location of
the library on your computer, at the appropriate time. The compiler will need
to know this at the point that you compile code, with the language runtime or
runtime loader needing the location every time you execute a program that uses
`libcue`.

Some compilers and runtimes expect you to specify locations explicitly; some
check predefined lists of locations; and some can be controlled through
environment variables and settings. The location where you store the shared
library will depend on your operating system, the permissions you have on your
computer, and the specific compiler and build system that you intend to use
`libcue` with.

On a Unix system such as Linux
the value of the environment variable `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
and the contents of the file `/etc/ld.so.conf`
are commonly used to control the behaviour of the runtime loader,
as explained in The Linux Documentation Project's
[Program Library](https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO/shared-libraries.html)
guide. Documentation for Windows
[also exists](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dynamic-link-library-search-order?redirectedfrom=MSDN#search_order_for_desktop_applications).

Here is an example of how to make `libcue` available to compilers and runtimes,
system-wide, under Linux:

{{{with script "en" "mv libcue"}}}
cp libcue.so /usr/local/lib/
{{{end}}}

On a Linux system your user probably won't have write access to the
`/usr/local/lib` directory. If so, you will need to run the `cp` command as a
more privileged user -- possibly the `root` user, accessed via `sudo` or `su`.
{{{end}}}

{{<info>}}
How-to guides and tutorials on cuelang.org that use `libcue` assume that it has
been compiled as a shared library as described above, and has been made
available system-wide with an appropriate filename.

<!-- TODO(jcm): add a test use of the lib. Something utterly trivial and C-based? -->
