The library `cue-api-java` provides a way to use CUE from Java programs.
This tutorial helps you get started using `cue-api-java`,
after you have installed it successfully.

{{<info>}}
`cue-api-java` is an experimental technology preview. This means that it's
under development and its behaviour might change from one release to the next.
{{</info>}}

## Prerequisites

- You need the low-level library
  [libcue](https://github.com/cue-lang/libcue)
  to be compiled and available on your computer,
  which is demonstrated in the guide
  "{{< linkto/inline "howto/build-libcue-shared-library" >}}".
- You must have the Java library
  [cue-api-java](https://github.com/cue-lang/cue-api-java)
  compiled and available on your computer. The guide
  "{{< linkto/inline "howto/build-cue-api-java-jar" >}}"
  shows you how to compile and install it.
  *This tutorial needs you to install the same version as that guide.*
- Your computer needs to have the Java Development Kit (JDK)
  [version 22](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/22/)
  (or later) installed. If you need help choosing a distribution of Java,
  the site [whichjdk.com](https://whichjdk.com) is a useful guide.
  Note that many operating systems offer a "Long Term Support" version of Java,
  but this often means JDK version *21*, which isn't recent enough.
  Make sure that you have *version 22 or later!*

## Set up your environment

{{{with step}}}
Tell the operating system (and Java) where to find the library `libcue` on your
computer:

{{{with script "en" "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH"}}}
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/
{{{end}}}

If you have installed `libcue` into a different directory than `/usr/local/lib/`
then adapt the command to refer to that directory instead.
{{{end}}}

{{{with step}}}
Tell Java where to find the library `cue-api-java` on your computer:

{{{with script "en" "export CLASSPATH"}}}
export CLASSPATH='/usr/local/share/java/*'
{{{end}}}

If you have installed `cue-api-java` into a different directory than
`/usr/local/share/java/` then adapt the command to refer to that directory
instead.
{{{end}}}

{{{with step}}}
Cross-check the value of this important variable:

{{{with script "en" "check CLASSPATH"}}}
echo "$CLASSPATH"
{{{end}}}

Java's requirements mean that we need the value of the `CLASSPATH` variable to
end with an asterisk -- **make sure you see the trailing `*`**.

If this value ends with a filename instead of an asterisk (for example:
`/usr/local/share/java/CUE.jar`) then you need to fix this.
Repeat the previous step while making sure that you surround the value of the
variable with quotes (`'`) when you `export` it.
{{{end}}}

{{{with step}}}
Check that this tutorial's prerequisites are present:

{{{with script "en" "check prereqs"}}}
javac --version
ls $LD_LIBRARY_PATH | grep libcue.so || echo 'fail!'
ls $CLASSPATH | grep /CUE.*jar$ || echo 'fail!'
{{{end}}}

If any of these commands fail then your computer doesn't have the related
prerequisite installed as expected and **this is a problem that you need to fix
before continuing with this tutorial.**
{{{end}}}

{{{with step}}}
Create a directory to hold some files, and change into it:

{{{with script "en" "mkdir chdir"}}}
mkdir -p cue-java-api-tutorials
cd cue-java-api-tutorials
{{{end}}}
{{{end}}}

## Create a Java program

{{{with step}}}
Place this Java program in the file `GetStarted.java`:

{{{with upload "en" "code"}}}
-- cue-java-api-tutorials/GetStarted.java --
import org.cuelang.cue.*;

public class GetStarted {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Begin by creating a context. Every CUE value must come from a
        // context, and every CUE operation must use CUE values that come from
        // the *same* context.
        var ctx = new CueContext();

        // The compile() method loads CUE passed as a string and evaluates it.
        var a1 = ctx.compile("x: true");
        var b1 = ctx.compile("y: 42");

        // The equals() method checks concrete values for equality.
        var a2 = ctx.compile("x: false");
        var b2 = ctx.compile("y: 42");
        System.out.println("a1 equals a2:\t\t\t" + a1.equals(a2));
        System.out.println("b1 equals b2:\t\t\t" + b1.equals(b2));

        // The unify() method unifies CUE values, returning a new CUE value.
        var c1 = ctx.compile("a: int");
        var c2 = ctx.compile("a: 5");
        var c3 = ctx.compile("b: true");
        var c = c1.unify(c2).unify(c3);
        var d = ctx.compile("{ a: 5, b: true }");
        System.out.println("c equals d:\t\t\t\t" + c.equals(d));

        // The lookup() method extracts a CUE value from a struct.
        var s = ctx.compile("""
            A: {
                val: 1
                B: {
                    val: 1
                }
            }
        """);
        var sAval  = s.lookup("A").lookup("val");
        var sABval = s.lookup("A.B.val");
        System.out.println("A.val equals A.B.val:\t" + sAval.equals(sABval));
    }
}
{{{end}}}
{{{end}}}

## Compile the program

{{{with step}}}
Compile the Java program:

{{{with script "en" "javac"}}}
javac GetStarted.java
{{{end}}}

The Java compiler automatically uses the value of the `CLASSPATH` environment
variable to locate the JAR file containing `cue-api-java`.
{{{end}}}

## Run the program

{{{with step}}}
Run the Java program:

{{{with script "en" "java"}}}
java --enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED -cp .:$CLASSPATH GetStarted
{{{end}}}

The Java runtime must be told about a slightly different classpath from the
compiler, through the `-cp` flag, because it needs to locate both the
`cue-api-java` JAR *and* your compiled code. The `--enable-native-access` flag
avoids a runtime warning that the
[Foreign Function & Memory API](https://openjdk.org/jeps/454) is being used by
`cue-api-java`.
{{{end}}}
