title: Value Constraints
weight: 30
draft: true
---

Value constraints allow for more fine-grained validation than just type-based checks.
Although types often suffice for programming, it is too coarse for configuration.

CUE allows defining separate restrictions on

By using references, CUE also allows defining detailed relations between fields.

## Unary comparators

The binary {{{reference "comparators"}}} `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `!`, `=~`, and
`!~` can also be used as a validator.  For instance, where `number` defines the
set of all whole numbers, `<10` defines the set of all numbers less than `10`.

{{{with sidetrack}}}
More specifically, for any concrete `x`, `x & ⊗y` is an error if not `x ⊗ y` and
`x` otherwise
{{{end}}}

{{{with code "en" "unary-comparator-ok"}}}
#check changed from single node
-- in.cue --
a: >10
a: 11

// Numeric bounds get simplified when possible.
b: >=10
b: <=10

// string must start with a capital letter.
s: =~#"^\p{Lu}"#
s: "Cat"
-- out.cue --
a: 11
b: 10
s: "Cat"
{{{end}}}

A bound that fails results in an error.

{{{with code "en" "unary-comparator-err"}}}
-- in.cue --
e: =~"foo"
e: "bar"
-- out.err --
e: invalid value "bar" (out of bound =~"foo"):
    ./in.cue:1:4
    ./in.cue:2:4
{{{end}}}

## Validators

A function in the {{{reference "standard-library"}}}  that returns a single error
value is called a validator and validates that a value is valid.
In this case the first argument in the Go documentation is the type of the
validated value and must be omitted.

{{{with code "en" "stdlib-validator"}}}
-- in.cue --
import "list"

a: [1, 2, 3]
a: list.MinItems(4)
-- out.err --
a: invalid value [1,2,3] (does not satisfy list.MinItems(4)): len(list) < MinItems(4) (3 < 4):
    ./in.cue:4:4
    ./in.cue:3:4
    ./in.cue:4:18
{{{end}}}

## Timestamps

Time stamps are a common data type.
CUE does not support timestamps in the language, but its standard library
provides validators to interpret strings as such.

{{{with code "en" "stdlib-time"}}}
-- in.cue --
import "time"

valid: time.Time
valid: "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z"
-- out.cue --
valid: "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z"
{{{end}}}

Certain CUE adaptors may convert these validators to or from format-specific
types.

<!-- TODO: CUE OpenAPI generation seems to be broken wrt to this. Make this work.

{{{with code "en" "stdlib-time-jsonschema"}}}
#norun should ignore this block because it's in an HTML comment
-- in.cue --
import "time"

#Meetup: {
	time:  time.Time
	place: string
}
-- out.jsonschema --
{{{end}}}
