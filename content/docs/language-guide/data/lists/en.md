CUE lists are identical to JSON lists.

List elements are considered to be a special kind of data field, with elements
indexed by their position.

{{{with code "en" "list-example"}}}
#norun open lists
-- in.cue --
a: [1, 2]
"a": [1, 2, 3]
-- out.cue --
a: [1, 2, 3]
{{{end}}}

<!-- TODO

a: 3: 4 // ok

a:Â  5: 6 // introduces gap.

<sidebar: CUE has a construct called associative lists which allows redefining how composition works>
