CUE is an open source project.

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to the CUE project must be accompanied by a [Developer Certificate

the `Signed-off-by` line with an email address that matches the commit author.
This line asserts the Developer Certificate of Origin.

## Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
primarily use [Gerrit code

also support [GitHub Pull Requests](https://github.com/cue-lang/cue/pulls).
Please read the [Contribution

submitting a change.

## Code of Conduct
