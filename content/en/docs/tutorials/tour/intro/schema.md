In CUE, schemas are typically written as Definitions.
A definition is a field which identifier starts with
`#` or `_#`.
This tells CUE that they are to be used for validation and should
not be output as data; it is okay for them to remain unspecified.

A definition also tells CUE the full set of allowed fields.
In other words, definitions define "closed" structs.
Including a `...` in struct keeps it open.
