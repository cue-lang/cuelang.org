      "message": "That\u0027s a really good point - I\u0027ve basically added your comment in the CUE source, advising that it shouldn\u0027t be reverted when we\u0027d otherwise, normally, remove pre-release references (i.e. just after minor v0.14.0/v0.15.0/v0.16.0/etc releases).\n\nThe slight nuance is that folks updating the `cue help experiments` text should now keep a somewhat longer window of time in mind, before they remove a `stable` or `withdrawn` experiment from the text. In other words, just because an experiment has been `stable`/`withdrawn` for long enough that it should be removed, *now* it should wait to be removed for some longer period - possibly (IMHO; off the top of my head) for an additional minor release cycle.",

Whether `cue help experiments` should grow in length forever is a different problem, which we might need to worry about in a year or two :)",
