      "message": "Thanks for your time discussing this. I\u0027ve removed all `go mod tidy` steps, which has the benefit of shortening all CUE and YAML on the page - including this section\u0027s longer CUE file.\n\nI\u0027ve also removed the `#goVersion` definition and the setup-go `name` field; and have removed the prose about package unification from this section.\n\nI\u0027m not sure we can make this much shorter, such that it fits on a single \"normal\" laptop screen. I\u0027ve added a definition scope explanation, now that we have only the one definition (because previously, with 2 definitions, the combination of comment+def1+def2 gets a blank line placed between def1 and def2 when `cue fmt` runs, which elgonated the doc), which could be removed. It feels like a useful thing to mention, however, for the audience we anticipate will read this doc.\n\nPTAL!",

Instead of putting lengthy prose in the comments, we have numbered comments in the prose, and then cross reference those from a numbered list that follows.
