It feels like you are trying to provide an abbreviated form of https://pkg.go.dev/cuelang.org/go/cue#section-directories. I would do just that, but you don\u0027t have to list all packages: `...` could indicate \"there are other packages\". Alternatively, you could avoid the partial listing and refer people to https://pkg.go.dev/cuelang.org/go and expand the directory view (the package one-liner should give a sufficient explanation). Maybe @mvdan@mvdan.cc has ideas on whether including a partial list vs none is better.",
