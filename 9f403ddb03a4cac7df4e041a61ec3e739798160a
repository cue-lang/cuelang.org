      "message": "Is this comment is a reference to the fact that `/docs/reference/command/cue-help-experiments/` contains the text \"This command is only available in a recent CUE pre-release.\"? If so, I\u0027m not clear that it should persist once `cue help experiments` is released. It is incorrect to say that `cue help experiments` is only available in the pre-release. A page that demonstrates an experiment, whether available in an actual or pre-release, should make clear the version requirement. This page will be trying to do too much otherwise, and it\u0027s not necessary IMO.",
