My main concern arises from the fact that we\u0027re still relatively near the top of a page that talks about validating data, and it feels like we\u0027re trying to exhaustively list in precise terms what we can do. I wonder if there\u0027s a way we can prioritise what to include in this list, dropping down to examples. Happy to iterate offline on how we can simplify this. For example, I think showing an example where the constraints come from a CUE package + CUE file is an edge-case.",
