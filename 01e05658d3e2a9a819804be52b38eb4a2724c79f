      "message": "I dug around briefly, and rediscovered what I found out the /last/ time I looked at the social media header icons.\n\nThe icon needs to be part of the hugo/static/img/ui.svg multi-logo file. I don\u0027t know how it\u0027s intended to be added in there, or if there\u0027s a (manually-triggered) build process that merges files from where you already added it (hugo/assets/svg/ui/). If there is, I\u0027ve never seen it being invoked!\n\nIn case there /is/ something scripted, I\u0027ve also left a copy of the file where you placed it (with a `social-` prefix, as is the custom).\n\nFeel free to squash this into your change.",
