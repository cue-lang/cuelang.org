This is a change where we need tip to differ from cuelang.org, and where cuelang.org being a unique deployment is the entire point of this change.\n\nAfter we land this change we\u0027ll need to quickly check the contents of cuelang.org, and revert immediately if the page contains `noindex, nofollow`.",

      "message": "`robots.txt` and the `\u003cmeta name\u003drobots\u003e` element serve different purposes:\n\n- `robots.txt` tells search engine crawlers what parts of the site they’re allowed to access, but doesn\u0027t prevent indexing if the URL is linked to, from elsewhere.\n- The `meta` element, which this CL affects, controls indexing and link-following behavior on a per-page basis after it’s been fetched - potentially after being linked from elsewhere (e.g. GerritHub trybot replies, GitHub issues, etc)\n\nWe should use both methods to disallow crawling and indexing of non-production sites - this CL addresses just the one, in isolation, as it\u0027s easy to do so via the `HUGO_ENV` envvar. Varying the `robots.txt` contents on a per-site basis is unresolved.",
