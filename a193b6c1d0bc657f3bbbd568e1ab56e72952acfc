      "message": "PTAnotherL.\n\nI\u0027ve reworked this, splitting out the \"active\" functions (`Sort`/`SortStrings`) from the \"passive\" test-related functions.\n\nThis has allowed me to bring these guides into line with a useful pattern that\u0027s emerging: functions that can be used as validators receive a matching pair of similarly-named guides - one for their boolean return form, and one for their use as a validator. This is bringing consistency to such functions\u0027 page titles (and URLs) across the board, where we end up with this pair:\n\n- using the built-in function Foo to report if a foo is in a list\n- using the built-in function Foo to validate that a foo is in a list\n\nI\u0027m hoping you\u0027ll agree that the consistency of \"report if\" implying \"there\u0027s a boolean return\" and \"validate that\" implying \".. can be used as a field validator\" is a win for the user.",
