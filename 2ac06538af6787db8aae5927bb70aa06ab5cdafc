      "message": "PTAL.\n\nI added this because it has slightly concerned me (both when running these checks locally on cuelang.org whilst updating the workflow command and when looking at the in-CI invocations) that I wasn\u0027t 100% confident in what checks were being run, especially in light of problems like cue-lang/cue#3897.\n\nI say \"like\" because I recognise that 3897 is now resolved in a way which would have protected this workflow command - this change gives us confidence (**if** we ever find we need to examime CI\u0027s output) that we\u0027ll know what checks passed. This CL would have felt less necessary (but not wholly unnecessary) if cue-lang/cue#3900 hadn\u0027t been discovered whilst working on providing better assurances that some baseline number of checks were being performed.",
