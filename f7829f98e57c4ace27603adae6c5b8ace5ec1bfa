      "message": "can you document what w does here? it\u0027s not immediately obvious to me at least.\n\nassuming it means \"write your own unique string for the purposes of hashing to w\", consider something like `writeHashTo`, akin to io\u0027s `WriteTo`.\n\nthough, per my other comment, \"write hash to\" feels a bit off when you don\u0027t actually require the writing of a hash, which is usually a fixed size. perhaps `writeToHasher`, since it\u0027s more like \"write all of your relevant contents into a hasher\"?",

      "message": "consider writing the top-level logic here like:\n\n```\nif rf.skipCache {\n  [...]\n} else if cacheMiss {\n  [...]\n} else {\n  [...]\n}\n```\n\nI mention this because there are really just two lines which are shared currently in `rf.skipCache || cacheMiss`, the last two. All the others are an if/else to see which of the two cases you\u0027re actually in. And IMO \"I don\u0027t want any caching at all\" and \"the cache is enabled but it\u0027s a miss\" are different enough cases to be separate.",
