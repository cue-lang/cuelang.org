      "message": "PTAL. I\u0027m not 100% sure that the multi-line string emitted by `go run .` is optimal - it seems to rely on downstream consumers being able to parse CUE string representations. Can we update the Go to emit the same output as the `cue` command example in step 3? Or perhaps the same string that it /would/ emit if the `--out text` were omitted (i.e. a single-line string with embedded literal `\\n` newlines)?",
