      "message": "nit: name this more clearly for the GHA UI user. \n\nI only understood this name as being an imperative instruction to the reader after digging into the CUE source and reading the comments. \n\nI initially thought it was a description of what the job was /doing/ (as is the case with a majority of GHA jobs), and was confused when it\u0027s body contained only a test. This was partly because I initially read it in the YAML file, not CUE: as the GHA UI user will be doing. \n\nI suggest a name that starts with \"Test that ..\" or \"Fail if ...\".",
