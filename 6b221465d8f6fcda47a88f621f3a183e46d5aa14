I think we should be more high-level with these descriptions. Good points to cover here are whether this is a data or schema integration (which you do, and to have a common structure to the description, e.g. the first sentence includes that data/schema point.\n\nI\u0027m going to need to sit and think about how to make them more high-level in a way which is still useful for the reader who\u0027s merely glancing at this marketing-focused page.\n\n\u003e We also need to be careful to not limit this to talking about files, because JSON and Yaml can come from anywhere for example.",
