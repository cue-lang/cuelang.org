      "message": "So we *won\u0027t* remove the `_public` dir **if we\u0027re invoking this script from `_scripts/serve.bash`**?\n\nThat seems backwards to me: don\u0027t we explicitly /want/ to remove `_public` if we\u0027re running `serve` locally? I know the deletion of `--renderToDisk` /should/ stop Hugo using `_public`, but I can\u0027t conceive of a flow where we want to:\n\n- have content in `_public`, built by some immediately-preceding process because the directory\u0027s gitignored\n- run `serve`\n- have hugo ignore the content in `_public`, because of no `--renderToDisk`\n- finish running serve\n- still have the same content in `_public`",

      "message": "Serve now doesn\u0027t care about `_public`; it doesn\u0027t use it, and therefore it shouldn\u0027t remove it.\n\nThe non-serve execute _does_ care about public, because that\u0027s the ultimate target. For the reasons in the comment, the `preprocessor` (and hugo) can\u0027t be trusted to \"tidy up\" target directories, so we remove those target directories to be safe.\n\nThe edge case here is that we don\u0027t remove `hugo/content` in the case of serve. Per our conversation yesterday, we avoid doing so to avoid triggering the race condition on resolution of `ref` and `relref` shortcodes. But as we discussed, this is a situation we will fix, just not one we can or want to fix here. Again, serve doesn\u0027t use/touch `_public` so it shouldn\u0027t remove it.",
