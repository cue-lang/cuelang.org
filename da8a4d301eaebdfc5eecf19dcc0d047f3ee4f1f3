TIL! \n\nRe quoting, here we are safe. Because we are printing the name of a variable, which gets expanded at runtime in bash itself.\n\nBut I have added a TODO in the code to tidy things up.\n\nThe mitigating factor here is that all of this execution happens within a container, and so the blast radius is limited.",
