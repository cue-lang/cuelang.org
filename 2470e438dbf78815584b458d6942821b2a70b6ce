      "message": "This is very busy with two modules in the example, one of which we can\u0027t see. I think it suffices to show just the k8s example to keep it short, and briefly mention in the text that the output will also include dependencies. Where we can keep things brief with less text to absorb, we make it easier for the reader. Where there is more text, it becomes a much more daunting prospect. And for no clear win here, because the below-the-line text explains what is going on for the interested user who hasn\u0027t already work out what\u0027s going on themselves.",
