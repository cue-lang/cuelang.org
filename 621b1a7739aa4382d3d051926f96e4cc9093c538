It\u0027s been pretty frustrating!\n\nIf you find the opportunity to take a look and can figure out any kind of hint for me, I\u0027ll progress it next week.\n\nIf not, I\u0027ll fall back to a dumb script, as per the commit message.\n\nEither option is 100% fine by me - the only variable is the resulting CUE purity of the codebase!",
