      "message": "Paul: it\u0027s tempting to see this guide as part of the CUE By Example set, in that defaults\u0027 basic behaviours can be expressed in a single CUE+YAML+Terminal 3-way code-block.\n\nBut if we do so, and remove 80% of the content in this CL, then there are some significant corner cases that won\u0027t be covered. I.e. most of the H2s in this CL, beyond the first. I don\u0027t think this non-trivial set of nuances should go unexplained, but I concede that perhaps they\u0027re not Howto Guide material.\n\nShould we swap out this doc for a far shorter CUE By Example, and place the rest of this doc\u0027s (IMHO!) pretty decent content into a Defaults Concept Guide, which we also link from the How-to Guide?",
