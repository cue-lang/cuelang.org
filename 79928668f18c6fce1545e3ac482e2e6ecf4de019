The manual trigger (via push to ci/test) successfully triggered the daily_tip_check workflow:\n\nhttps://github.com/cue-lang/cuelang.org/actions/runs/6164342477/job/16729860063\n\nThis in turn successfully triggered a scheduled\u003dtrue trybot workflow run:\n\nhttps://github.com/cue-lang/cuelang.org/actions/runs/6164344298/job/16729864906\n\nand that failed as expected because the commit at the tip of alpha at that point in time (https://github.com/cue-lang/cuelang.org/commit/79928668f18c6fce1545e3ac482e2e6ecf4de019) contains the `Preprocessor-No-Write-Cache: true` trailer. \n\nJust as a health check, the same commit succeed at the tip of alpha as expected:\n\nhttps://github.com/cue-lang/cuelang.org/actions/runs/6164328605/job/16729818017\n\nFinal check is to finish and merge the next CL in the stack which regenerates the cache files to confirm:\n\na) Netlify deploys \nb) the trybot workflow at the tip of alpha succeeds\nc) we can manually trigger the daily_tip_check workflow\nd) the trybot workflow resulting from the daily_tip_check succeeds",
