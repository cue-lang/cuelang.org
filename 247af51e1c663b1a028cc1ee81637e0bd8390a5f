      "message": "I\u0027m not sure I agree. The repetition is a function of the changes being made at each boilerplate-removal \"step\":\n\n- amend one or more data files and display their new contents\n- add boilerplate-removal CUE into \u003csome file\u003e and show the file\n- demonstrate that the combination of new data files and new CUE produces the same output by running exporting YAML.\n\nI don\u0027t think that changing to a script can eliminate this repetition.\n\nAlso, given that the rendered form of each code block is pretty much as small as it\u0027s possible to be, I suspect that moving to an upload/script block setup will elongate the page.\n\nLet\u0027s discuss. I\u0027m happy to throw out a version of the page which just changes the code blocks as upload/script blocks, without changing the prose, so we can see the impact on the rendered form, if that\u0027d be useful.\n\nI won\u0027t do a pass over the prose before we have a chat, however, as I feel that pass will be led by the choice we make, as the prose will be non-trivially different when introducing a code block versus upload/script sequences.",
