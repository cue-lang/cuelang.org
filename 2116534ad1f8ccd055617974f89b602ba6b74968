It appears that this will add 7.5 minutes to the end of master branch CI runs, post CL submission. Given the sequencing of this, I don\u0027t believe that should be a blocker, but I just thought I\u0027d mention it here for awareness.\n\nDo we record the results of these ad hoc tests anywhere? The job\u0027s logs will get reaped by GitHub in some small(ish) number of days, I suspect, making the URL\u0027s inclusion in the commit message unhelpful.",
