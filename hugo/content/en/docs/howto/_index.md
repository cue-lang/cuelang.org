tooling, and include:

- {{< tag "tooling" >}} -- guides that demonstrate how to use CUE tools
- {{< tag "commented cue" >}} -- guides that illustrate CUE language features
  and techniques through
  [stand-alone examples]({{< relref "about-commented-cue-guides" >}})
- {{< tag "encodings" >}} -- guides that explain how to encode and decode
  information stored in languages other than CUE
