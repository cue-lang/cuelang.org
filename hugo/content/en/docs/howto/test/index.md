`This is how an inline code block should look`

{{< step stepNumber="1" >}}
`This is an inline code block that renders without a contrasting background.`
This text follows, but is part of the same paragraph.
{{< /step >}}

{{< step stepNumber="2" >}}
`This is an inline code block that renders with a constrasting background.`

For some reason this existence of this following paragraph causes the background to render correctly.
{{< /step >}}
