This [Commented CUE]({{< relref "docs/howto/about-commented-cue-guides" >}})
demonstrates how to make sure a string has a minimum length, or a maximum
length, or both.

This CUE shows string fields being constrained by their lengths as expressed in
bytes, and also in runes, as introduced by
[the Go programming language](https://go.dev/blog/strings#code-points-characters-and-runes).

package example

import "strings"

// 2 examples that use only single-byte, ASCII characters
ascii_constrain_runes: "only ASCII characters" // 21 runes composed of 21 bytes
// enforce that the field contains between 2 and 8 runes
ascii_constrain_runes: strings.MinRunes(2) & strings.MaxRunes(8)

ascii_constrain_bytes: {
	// set up an alias to allow the following CUE to refer to it
	let content = "only ASCII characters" // 21 runes composed of 21 bytes

	// this embedded scalar ultimately sets the value of the containing field,
	// "ascii_constrain_bytes"
	content

	// enforce that "content" contains between 50 and 100 bytes
	#bytes: len(content) & >=50 & <=100
}

// 2 examples that use multi-byte, South Korean Hangul characters
multibyte_constrain_runes: "í•œê¸€" // 2 runes composed of 6 bytes
// enforce that the field contains 5 or fewer runes
multibyte_constrain_runes: strings.MaxRunes(5)

multibyte_constrain_bytes: {
	// set up an alias to allow the following CUE to refer to it
	let content = "í•œê¸€" // 2 runes composed of 6 bytes

	// this embedded scalar ultimately sets the value of the containing field,
	// "multibyte_constrain_bytes"
	content

	// enforce that "content" contains 5 or fewer bytes
	#bytes: len(content) & <=5
}

// 2 examples that use multi-byte, emoji characters
emoji_constrain_runes: "ðŸ˜„ðŸ¥µðŸ™ƒðŸ¥¶" // 4 runes composed of 16 bytes
// enforce that the field contains 10 or more runes
emoji_constrain_runes: strings.MinRunes(10)

emoji_constrain_bytes: {
	// set up an alias to allow the following CUE to refer to it
	let content = "ðŸ˜„ðŸ¥µðŸ™ƒðŸ¥¶" // 4 runes composed of 16 bytes

	// this embedded scalar ultimately sets the value of the containing field,
	// "emoji_constrain_bytes"
	content

	// enforce that "content" contains 10 or more bytes
	#bytes: len(content) & >=10

{{< info >}}
The `len()`-based examples use an embedded scalar value with an alias to permit
their fields to be of type `string` whilst *also* allowing their byte lengths
to be constrained.

This pattern will be obsoleted by the `must()` directive, which is tracked
in {{< issue 575 />}}.
