The CUE [Central Registry](https://registry.cue.works)
provides some carefully selected and curated
[CUE modules](https://cuelang.org/docs/concept/modules/) that you can use to
create validated configurations across a range of popular projects and
services, or to check that your existing configurations are valid.

Here are some common questions that folks have asked about curated modules.
Please do join [the CUE community](https://cuelang.org/community/) and ask us anything
you think we've missed!

## What curated modules are available?

The curated modules currently published cover:
- [Kubernetes](#kubernetes)
- [GitHub Actions](#github-actions)
- [GitLab CI/CD](#gitlab-cicd)
- [Buildkite Pipelines](#buildkite-pipelines)
- [Azure Pipelines](#azure-pipelines)
- [Argo Workflows](#argo-workflows)
- [GoReleaser](#goreleaser)
- [Docker Compose](#docker-compose)
- [npm's `package.json`](#npms-packagejson)

In the future, the search function of the Central Registry will be the easiest
way to discover suitable modules to use.

### Kubernetes
"*Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.*"
([kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io/))

Each package in this module is named after its respective Go source code package.
For example, to use the schemas defined in the Go package `k8s.io/api/core/v1` use the following:
```cue
import "github.com/cue-tmp/jsonschema-pub/exp3/k8s.io/api/core/v1"
```

- [Migrating to the Central Registry's curated Kubernetes Schemas]({{<relref"k8s-io-moving-from-cue-get-go-to-central-registry">}}) by replacing existing `cue get go` schemas
- The Central Registry's [module documentation](https://registry.cue.works/docs/github.com/cue-tmp/jsonschema-pub/exp3/k8s.io@v0.1.0)

### GitHub Actions
"*GitHub Actions makes it easy to automate all your software workflows, now with world-class CI/CD: build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub.*"
([github.com](https://github.com/features/actions))
```cue
import "github.com/cue-tmp/jsonschema-pub/exp3/githubactions"
```

### Azure Pipelines
"*Continuously build, test, and deploy to any platform and cloud.*"
([azure.microsoft.com](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops/pipelines/))
```cue
import "github.com/cue-tmp/jsonschema-pub/exp3/azurepipelines"
```

### Argo Workflows
"*An open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes.*"
([argo-workflows.readthedocs.io](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/))

We're aware that this module's import path is slightly unsuitable.
It will be updated soon, but is safe to use as-is:
```cue
import argoworkflows "github.com/cue-tmp/jsonschema-pub/exp3/argocd"
```

## Why are curated modules published in a temporary namespace?

Well spotted! The import paths you *currently* need to use for a curated module
include a `cue-tmp/jsonschema-pub/exp3` component.
This definitely looks a bit
"temporary" - which it is, but only while the proper namespace is being
decided.

At some point in the future the curated modules will be published in
their proper namespace. But you can rest easy, because one important property
of the
[Central Registry](https://registry.cue.works)
is that, once a schema is published, it will always be available at that
location. Your CUE can rely on the "temporary" paths mentioned on this page for
as long as you like. When the proper namespace is decided, you can then easily
use the
[`cue refactor imports`](https://cuelang.org/docs/reference/command/cue-help-refactor-imports/)
command to update your CUE.

## What do I need to use a curated module?

You'll need to authenticate to the CUE
[Central Registry](https://registry.cue.works).
We also suggest that you upgrade to
[the latest version](https://cuelang.org/docs/introduction/installation/)
of CUE so that you can switch to the new evaluator.
All curated modules are tested using `evalv3`, so its use is strongly recommended.
Many questions about `evalv3` are answered in
[Upgrading from evalv2 to evalv3](https://cuelang.org/docs/concept/faq/upgrading-from-evalv2-to-evalv3/)
-- and if you have an unanswered question, please join
[the CUE community](https://cuelang.org/community/) and ask for help!
