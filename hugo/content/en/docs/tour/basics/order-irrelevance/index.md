title: Order is Irrelevant
weight: 210
---

CUE's core operations are defined so that
the order in which configurations are combined is unimportant.\
We say that **order is irrelevant** in CUE.

This crucial property explains how CUE is able to handle a field being specified
[multiple times]({{< relref "duplicate-fields" >}}).
Because each occurrence of a field is as important as every other,
*all* occurrences must not conflict with each other.

Order irrelevance makes it easy for humans _and_ machines to reason about values, and
makes advanced tooling and automation possible.
