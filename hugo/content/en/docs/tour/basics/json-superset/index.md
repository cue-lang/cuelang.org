CUE is a superset of JSON.
It adds the following conveniences:

- C-style comments,
- quotes may be omitted from field names without special characters,
- commas at the end of fields are optional,
- comma after last element in list is allowed,
- outer curly braces are optional.

JSON objects are called structs in CUE.
An object member is called a field.

{{< code-tabs >}}
{{< code-tab name="json.cue" language="cue" area="top-left" >}}
one: 1
two: 2

// A field using quotes.
"two-and-a-half": 2.5

list: [
	1,
	2,
	3,
]
{{< /code-tab >}}
{{< code-tab name="result.txt" language="txt" area="top-right" >}}
{
    "one": 1,
    "two": 2,
    "two-and-a-half": 2.5,
    "list": [
        1,
