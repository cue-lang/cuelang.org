**Strings** are instances of the `string` type.
String literals are defined within double quotes.

Strings allow a rich set of escape sequences,
including Unicode code points
and [interpolations]({{< relref "../expressions/interpolation" >}}).

CUE also supports multi-line strings, enclosed by a pair of triple quotes (`"""`).
The opening quotes of a multi-line string must be immediately followed by a newline,
and the closing quotes must be on a line by themselves, optionally preceded by whitespace.
Any whitespace before the closing quotes must also prefix the lines between the quotes,
because it is removed from all lines.
