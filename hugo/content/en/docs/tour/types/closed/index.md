title: Closed structs
weight: 80
---

A struct may be **open** or **closed**, and is open *unless* it has been closed.

Both open and closed structs can have any field defined as members.\
Closed structs can only be
[unified]({{< relref "docs/tour/basics/duplicate-fields" >}})
with structs that have fields permitted by the closed struct.

A closed struct can be created using the `close()` builtin, but is more
commonly created using a *definition*, as demonstrated on the next page.
A struct created with `close()` can't have additional fields added elsewhere.
