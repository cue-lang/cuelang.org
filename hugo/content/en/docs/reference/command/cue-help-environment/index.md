$ cue help environment
The cue command consults environment variables for configuration.
If an environment variable is unset or empty, sensible default setting is used.

	CUE_CACHE_DIR
		A directory structure to hold files which are reused between operations.
		It defaults to a directory for user-specific temporary data, such as:

		- "$XDG_CACHE_HOME/cue" or "$HOME/.cache/cue" on Linux
		- "$HOME/Library/Caches/cue" on MacOS
		- "%LocalAppData%/cue" on Windows

		Its contents are generally read-only and include:

		- mod/download for modules fetched from registries
		- mod/extract for extracted module archives

	CUE_CONFIG_DIR
		A directory to hold configuration and long-lived state files.
		It defaults to a directory for user-specific persistent data, such as:

		- "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cue" or "$HOME/.config/cue" on Linux
		- "$HOME/Library/Application Support/cue" on MacOS
		- "%AppData%/cue" on Windows

	CUE_REGISTRY
		The configuration to use when downloading and publishing modules.
		See "cue help registryconfig" for details.

	CUE_EXPERIMENT
		Comma-separated list of experiment flags to enable or disable:

		modules (default true)
			Enable support for the Modules and package management proposal
			as described in https://cuelang.org/discussion/2939.
		yamlv3decoder (default true)
			Enable the new YAML decoder based on yaml.v3.
		evalv3
			Enable the new CUE evaluator, addressing performance issues
			and bringing a better disjunction algorithm.

	CUE_DEBUG
		Comma-separated list of debug flags to enable or disable, such as:

		http
			Log a JSON message per HTTP request and response made
			when interacting with module registries.

CUE_EXPERIMENT and CUE_DEBUG are comma-separated lists of key-value strings,
where the value is a boolean "true" or "1" if omitted. For example:

	CUE_EXPERIMENT=toenable,todisable=0

```
