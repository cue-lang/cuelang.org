CUE has a powerful scripting layer.

More on this later.

For now, we refer to the documentation included in the CUE tool itself:
```
$ cue help cmd
```
or the "Define Commands" section of the
[Kubernetes Tutorial](https://github.com/cue-labs/cue-by-example/blob/main/003_kubernetes_tutorial/README.md).

User-defined command line flags are not yet supported.
