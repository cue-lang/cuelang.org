## Welcome to CUE

CUE is an open-source data validation language and inference engine
with its roots in logic programming.
Although the language is not a general-purpose programming language,
it has many applications, such as
data validation, data templating, configuration, querying,
code generation and even scripting.
The inference engine can be used to validate
data in code or to include it as part of a code generation pipeline.

### CUE's documentation
