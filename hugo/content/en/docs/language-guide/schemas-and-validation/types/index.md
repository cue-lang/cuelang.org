## Basic Types

In the Data section we saw that CUE supports numbers, strings, bytes, bool,
null, lists, and maps.

CUE has predeclared identifiers that represent these categories. An `int` is
just a `number` which is an integer.

<!--

Any, Boolean, Integer, Number, String, Bytes.

#any, #boolean, #integer, #number, #string, #bytes.

-->

## Composite Types

Generic lists are represented as `[]` and generic maps as `{}`.
In addition, CUE also defines `_` to mean “any” type.
