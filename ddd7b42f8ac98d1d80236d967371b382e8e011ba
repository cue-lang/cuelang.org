      "message": "**This** is the length and form that I think the \"custom registry\" mirror of this tutorial should adopt. The brevity is *fab*!\n\nWhilst it might be slightly fiddly to achieve, I think we should make this tutorial\u0027s examples copy-n-paste-able, removing the `cueckoo` text from as many command blocks as possible.\n\nIn comments, I suggest perhaps using envvars, but that\u0027s just an obvious idea. I really don\u0027t think we should require the user to be constantly watching out for places where we\u0027ve told them to type a command that explicitly won\u0027t work; or, if we do, we should visually flag each and every occurrence, somehow. Of those two options, however, I strongly prefer the option of reducing the \"wrong\" commands down to a single one or (if it\u0027s even possible) zero.",
