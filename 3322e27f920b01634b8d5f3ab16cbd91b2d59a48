I\u0027ve added a pointer to the pkg.go.dev list of releases and pre-releases, and also an example of `@master`.\n\nI think that demonstrating any /specific/ pre-release will be either unhelpful on the page, or will turn into an update chore, because either:\n\n- we\u0027ll be in the current, post release state, where the only available pre-prelease we could mention is older than the `latest` release; or\n- we\u0027ll have real, up-to-date pre-releases we /could/ mention, but we\u0027ll need to remember to manually update the pre-release that\u0027s specified periodically. We can\u0027t use the `prerelease` var that  `site.cue` sets up because it gets aligned with the `latest` version periodically.",
