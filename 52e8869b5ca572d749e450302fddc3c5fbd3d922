      "message": "The purpose behind the `l` and `e` prefix, and the slightly odd naming, is to emit fields where their values are vertically aligned, but `cue eval` doesn\u0027t align lists on sequential lines.\n\nI noticed that clarity for the reader seemed to be significantly improved if I could scan up and down the 4 output fields\u0027 values (original list; flattened x1; flattened x2; flattened completely) which then allowed me to trivially notice the vertically differences between them. Even a 1 character horizontal offset degrades this experience, so I opted for slightly worse names, all containing 4 characters.\n\nI\u0027ve come up with some better names that also align.",
