// package gerritstatusupdater defines a serverless function that updates
// Gerrit CLs in response to webhook callbacks from GitHub workflow events
// that fire in response to workflow runs in a GitHub repository.
//
// gerritstatusupdater works as follows (using the example of a trybot
// workflow):
//
//   - Project github.com/my/project defines at least two workflows: a trybot
//     workflow that should be run for each CL/PR, and a repository dispatch
//     workflow that is fired by running cmd/cueckoo runtrybot (see below).
//   - github.com/my/project is imported into GerritHub as
//     review.gerrithub.io/q/project:my/project. github.com/my/project is
//     now the mirror target of the GerritHub source of truth.
//   - github.com/my/project-trybot is established as the repository within
//     which CI runs for CLs against review.gerrithub.io/q/project:my/project.
//     This repository has no secrets and is basically an empty shell that
//     defines a placeholder for the trybot workflow.
//   - Developers with write access to github.com/my/project use cmd/cueckoo to
//     run trybots for CLs against review.gerrithub.io/q/project:my/project. This
//     pushes a build branch named trybot/$changeID/$revisionID to
//     github.com/my/project-trybot. This triggers the trybot workflow.
//   - Workflow events triggered by the running of the trybot workflow fire
//     webhook events. gerritstatusupdater is configured in
//     github.com/my/project-trybot as a consumer of those events.
//   - According to the configuration of gerritstatusupdater, those webhook
//     events are converted into status updates on the CL that corresponds to the
//     originating build branch (the Gerrit API works using the $changeID and
//     $revisionID). The name of the workflow is used in the status updates written
//     to Gerrit CLs.
//
// The only constraint that must be satisfied between github.com/my/project and
// github.com/my/project-trybot is that the latter must define empty/shell
// GitHub Actions workflows for the workflow that will run as part of the
// trybots.  Indeed it is currently a limitation that only one workflow can be
// triggered (this constraint comes about because gerritstatusupdater cannot
// multiplex events from multiple disconnected workflows). Such an empty shell
// would look something like this:
//
//	# .github/workfows/test.yml
//	name: Test
//	"on":
//	  push:
//	    branches:
//	      - 'ci/**'
//	jobs:
//	  start:
//	    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
//	    defaults:
//	      run:
//	        shell: bash
//	    steps:
//	      - run: 'echo hello world'
//
// github.com/my/project would then have a workflow configuration such that
// for a trybot run, the .github/workfows/test.yml file in the pushed build
// branch would be run.
//
// gerritstatusupdater relies on a number of environment variables which are
// documented via the Env* constants in this package.
//
// In the future, this servless function could well become a GitHub App
// for convenience.

	// workflow contains. We therefore guard the trybot workflow with "has a
	// type trybot Dispatch-Trailer, or no Dispatch-Trailer" at all. The same
	// applies for unity, although in that case the guard is simpler: we only
	// run the workflow if we have a unity type trailer. This would seem to cover
	// us. However, because the condition sits on a job and not the workflow,
	// the workflow itself starts and we receive an event here in gerritstatusupdater
	// to that effect. We use that event to update the CL with "XYZ started".
	// However, the problem in the Unity repo is that this means we get events
	// for both the trybot and unity workflows, even though one of them will, for
	// a given commit, have all its jobs skipped. The solution here would seem to
	// be "simple, just write the 'starting' notice to the Gerrit CL when the job
	// starts". We can't do that however, because a trybot has multiple jobs as
	// part of a matrix: the "starting" notification has to come at the workflow
	// level.
	//
	// We can fix that by relying on the fact that the "trybot" and "unity" keys
	// are consistently used as the filename of the resulting YAML workflow file.
	// Therefore, if we receive an event with a Dispatch-Trailer of type "trybot"
	// but the workflow file associated with the event is .github/workflows/unity.yml
	// then we can drop the event: this case is the suprious situation of "crossed
	// wires" described above that we want to avoid.
