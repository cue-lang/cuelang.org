      "message": "FYI, this also means you are shadowing any other experiment set by the host env here; I wonder if the pattern might be to do `os.Setenv(\"CUE_EXPERIMENT\", os.Getenv(\"CUE_EXPERIMENT\")+\",evalv3\u003d0\")` so that the parent env var is not thrown away.\n\nAkin to how one might add an element to $PATH without throwing away the previous value.\n\nThis is the same bug that Roger unintentionally introduced in the services repo via `os.Setenv(\"CUE_EXPERIMENT\", \"embed\")` - which caused me to not be able to enable evalv3 at all.\n\nThis is currently tricky because empty elements in the comma-separated list are not allowed; I have sent https://review.gerrithub.io/c/cue-lang/cue/+/1208334 to relax that.",
