I can imagine a near term future where `cue vet` does more, akin to `go vet` or `staticcheck` versus `go build` or `go test`. And `cue help export` says \"evaluate\", not \"validate\", so it leaves that door open for us, as far as I can tell.\n\nI get that the docs are more intuitive if you use the word validate. I\u0027m just not sure that we\u0027re OK with promising to users that `cue vet` will always be a subset of `cue export`, as both perform validation given what you wrote here. cc @paul@myitcv.io for input; this is more of a mild concern for me.",
