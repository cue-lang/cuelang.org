      "message": "This still suggests mutating a value. \"We are creating a new value by combining (unifying) two values...\" is the essence of what we are trying to convey. That one of the values involved is \"placed\" at a path prior to unification is somewhat orthogonal and just a common convenience. \n\nIndeed one way of making things flow here is to look at building on the use of `cue.Value.Unify()` in the previous example. `FillPath` is a unification... but where one of the values (the argument) is \"placed\" at a specific path \"first\".\n\nPerhaps these ideas help with the language tweak?",
