      "message": "The grammar is not quite correct and I will fix that. What I was trying to say is that Hugo generally uses triple-backtick for code blocks (and indeed we rely on this in the output of the preprocessor in some places) but that it, like mkdocs, also understand quad-backtick. So the change is safe from the perspective of Hugo, just as it is for mkdocs.\n\nFixed.",
