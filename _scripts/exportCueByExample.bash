#  - any line with a text fenced code block is shell output
#  - shell output needs not to have a dollar-space prefix
#  - the opening of a code-tabs container isn't needed
#  - a text code-tab element is a text file (NB this isn't always correct!)
#  - a cue code-tab element is a CUE file
#  - the closing of a code-tabs container marks the end of a fenced code block

 The transformation of the source file $content
 was successful, but MUST NOT be assumed to be complete. Make sure you audit
 its output, paying close attention to:
 - shell commands with a prefix marked as "Actual command in CUE-By-Example guide" (or similar)
 - shell commands with output interleaved or inline, which will spoil the copy-code-pane button on GitHub
 - anything inside {{< ... >}} blocks, which don't mean anything in GitHub Markdown
 - relative URLs inside [markdown](/links), as these won't resolve on GitHub
 - fenced code blocks that originally had filetypes other than text might have been changed to "text"
