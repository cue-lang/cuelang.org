# Caching
# =======
# Somewhat confusingly below there are two mentions of the word "cache". Pages
# have caches in the form of gen_cache.cue files that determine whether a page
# script needs to be re-run or not by the preprocessor. Separately, when a page
# is (re-)run, the page can opt in to using a docker cache volume that is
# shared with other pages. The cache volume, for example, is used to create a
# shared Go cache between pages to optimise module download, Go builds etc.
#
# The following are largely orthogonal concerns that are accordingly afforded
# different flags in the preprocessor:
#
# * Whether gen_cache.cue files should initially be consulted to determine a
#   cache hit or otherwise: --skipcache
# * Whether gen_cache.cue files should be treated read-only (i.e. an error in
#   case of cache miss): --readonlycache
# * Whether a docker cache volume is available or not: --nocachevolume
#
# Bash variables named similarly to the flag names are used to hold the setting
# or otherwise of a flag.
#
# We have three environments in which this script runs:
#
# * Locally, in development
# * In CI, both as part of a trybot run, or on the default branch post submit
# * In Netlify during deploy
#
# Rather than declare a "fall-through" of logic, each environment is separately
# handled with comments to make clear the logic/reasoning behind each flag value.
#
# TODO: use different terminology, and possibly rename flags. e.g. rather than
# "cache" vs "cachevolume", call them "gencache" vs "cachevolume", or
# "gencache" vs "dockercache".

if [[ "${NETLIFY:-}" == "true" ]]; then
	# Netlify

	# We must have a cache hit in all gen_cache.cue files; setting
	# --readonlycache ensures we fail early in case there is a cache miss,
	# instead of re-running a page (which we cannot and do not want to do in
	# Netlify)
	readonlycache="--readonlycache"

	# hence the "run" should be fast as we quickly determine whether we have a
	# full cache hit or not.

	# We don't need a cache volume because we must have a cache hit. Setting
	# --nocachevolume is required to avoid the preprocessor eagerly creating
	# a docker volume. Netlify does not have docker available so if we did not
	# set this flag then the eager volume creation would fail.
	nocachevolume="--nocachevolume"

	# --skipcache cannot be set when --readonlycache is set. The setting of
	# --readonlycache above dominates in this case (per its motivation), and
	# hence we do not set --skipcache. In other words, if we want to ensure a

	# trybot repo (a low privilege environment where workflows run as part of
	# the review of CLs).

	# By default in CI we skip the reading of gen_cache.cue files. This is a safe
	# default in the main repo on the default branch, because we want to catch
	# stale gen_cache.cue files that slip through.

	if [[ "${CI_NO_SKIP_CACHE:-}" == "true" ]]; then
		# Skipping gen_cache.cue files means however we do a full re-run of each

		# trybots as part of a CL, would cause painfully slow CI runs. Especially
		# when we have the safe fallback default behaviour described above post
		# submit.
		#
		# Hence in workflows we set CI_NO_SKIP_CACHE=true. This has the effect of
		# signalling to this script that is is safe/intended/etc to use
		# gen_cache.cue files where there is a hit. The main example here being
		# the $repo-trybot repo, when the trybots run on CLs at review time. When
		# CI_NO_SKIP_CACHE=true, therefore we do not want to set --skipcache,
		# hence we set skipcache to empty.

	# Use a cache volume for this build. Whether the docker volume itself is
	# cached between CI runs (regardless of the repository) is not controlled
	# here; that is a function of the caching policy set in actions/cache/*
	# actions. Currently, docker volumes are _not_ part of the actions/cache
	# caches in any environment. For now, the use of a cache volume in CI simply
	# ensures that pages that opt in to use the cache volume use a shared disk.
	# Whilst they will race to fill caches like the Go modules cache, it does
	# optimise some redundant network work between pages as the cache gets
	# populated, even in a single run. Given that we do want a cache volume, we
	# therefore do not set --nocachevolume.

	# In CI, if we set --readonlycache, then we would correctly fail in case of

	# information as to why. More useful is to re-run where required because of
	# the gen_cache.cue miss, and then rely on the 'git commit clean' step to
	# show the differences.
