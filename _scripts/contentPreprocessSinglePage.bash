#
# Usage:
#   _scripts/contentPreprocessSinglePage.bash content/path/to/page [--preprocessor flags --and params]
#
# This is useful when the site's "infra" dependencies have changed (requiring a
# preprocessor container image rebuild), and you want to test out the
# preprocessor's behaviour without rebuilding the entire site.
# NB This script's use of git-restore probably has wierd corner cases, so
# *don't use this script to automate anything inside CI*. It's only a
# convenience for authors in its current state - hence the "content" filename
# prefix.

# target page (which should show up as modified, not deleted).
