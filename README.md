### `github.com/cue-lang/cuelang.org` - the home of cuelang.org

This repo is the home of [cuelang.org](https://cuelang.org). The site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and is
based on the [docsy](https://www.docsy.dev/) theme.

The [CUE Language Specification](https://cuelang.org/docs/references/spec/)
is generated from source files in the
[`cuelang.org/go`](https://pkg.go.dev/mod/cuelang.org/go) module.

The site is deployed and hosted via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

### Issue tracking

To raise an issue about a specific page or piece of content, scroll to the
bottom of the published page and use the "Report an Issue" link in the site
footer.
This link will save you time by prepopulating the issue with information that
you'll need to find and fill in if you raise the issue manually.

To raise an issue manually, please open it in the
[main CUE issue tracker](https://cuelang.org/issues),
giving the issue's title a "`cuelang.org: `" prefix.

### Requirements for local development

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) `v20.x`
* [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) `>= go1.21` (not needed for only running `hugo`)
* [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) `>= v0.124.0`
  (["extended"](https://gohugo.io/troubleshooting/faq/#i-get-this-feature-is-not-available-in-your-current-hugo-version)
  binary version)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) CLI `>= 19.03` (for [`docker
  buildx`](https://github.com/docker/buildx#installing) use, amongst other
  things)
   * [Podman](https://podman.io/) has been used successfully, instead of
     Docker, but its use is currently undocumented

### Developing the site locally

To serve the site locally run:

```
./_scripts/build.bash             # one-off to ensure everything works
./_scripts/serve.bash [--update]  # update flag writes changes back into source files under content/
```

The site will be served at http://localhost:1313/.

### Updating the version of CUE documented by the site

The site's CUE content is formatted, tested, and used to produce output by the
`latest` version of CUE stored in [`site.cue`](/site.cue).

See commit
https://github.com/cue-lang/cuelang.org/commit/80c17ba707e239adfe7794ffcfc79f314ed51841
(and the commit that comes after, updating cache files) for an example of how
to update this version.

The spec is handled by a different version of CUE, as tracked in cue-lang/cue#3013.
It is generated against the required version of the `cuelang.org/go` module:

```
go generate ./...
```

To update the generated spec you need to update the site's required version of `cuelang.org/go`:

```
go get cuelang.org/go@latest
```

### tip.cuelang.org

[tip.cuelang.org](https://tip.cuelang.org/) currently redirects to cuelang.org,
but it is intended that this site should:

- have the same template and content as
  [cuelang.org](https://cuelang.org), except that all pages will have their
  data formatted and output emitted by `cuelang.org/go@master`;
- be redeployed when any commit is added to to `master` on
  `cue-lang/cuelang.org` or [`cue-lang/cue`](https://github.com/cue-lang/cue).

This is not currently implemented, and is tracked in https://cuelang.org/issues/2538.
