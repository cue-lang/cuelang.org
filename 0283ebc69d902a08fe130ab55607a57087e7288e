      "message": "The first part of the first sentence of this above-the-line text is about something we will do later. Again, I think we need to move to plainer, more straight-to-the-point language. What is happening here? That\u0027s what the user is interested in. Not what is going to happen later, not the detail of the workflow struct (that is a below-the-line detail), not the fact that it came from `cue import`. No, what\u0027s happening here is that we are declaring a GitHub Actions workflow in CUE, based on an example from the GitHub documentation. Then show the example, then provide below-the-line detail.",
