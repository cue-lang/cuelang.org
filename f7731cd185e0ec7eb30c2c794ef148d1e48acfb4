The only other page that mentions its use is https://alpha.cuelang.org/docs/concept/data-validation-use-case/#migration-path, which isn\u0027t suitable to link to:\n\n```\n$ git grep \"cue import\" content | grep -v -e \"docs/reference/cli/cue-import\" -e \"docs/concept/(json|yaml)\"\ncontent/docs/concept/data-validation-use-case/en.md:CUE provides automated rewrite tools, such as `cue import` and `cue trim`\n```\n\n[Aside: I raised https://github.com/cue-lang/cue/issues/2875 whilst trying to discover candidate pages to link to.

Or we\u0027d need to add `{{{with script}}}` to this page, and spend more article-length (\u003d\u003d reader attention) on the process of:\n\n- uploading multiple JSON/YAML files, as appropriate for the page\n- scripting the files\u0027 import\n- cat\u0027ing the emitted CUE files\n\n... with appropriate explanation of any steps that weren\u0027t immediately obvious to the CUE newcomer who might be landing on this page.\n\nI considered this, but it felt like **significant** length to add to this page. \n\nThere\u0027s a TODO mentioning the need for a guide to link to, and https://github.com/cue-lang/docs-and-content/issues/66 has been raised to capture the same.",
