      "message": "I would advise against making this sentence entirely bold. \n\nBut that aside; it feels a bit awkward to have this: \"yes, CUE supports symlinks except where it doesn\u0027t\", broken out by headings. It feels like we\u0027re forcing the introduction of headings where we don\u0027t need them. Can we not simply explain the point that CUE generally does support symlinks and then explain the caveats?\n\nI also feel like we need a simply bullet list of the situations that are supported. We enumerate some of them by example below, having that list of things that are supported here adds emphasis to the fact that they are generally supported. \n\nThe wording on what is not supported can then be more plain in referring to module dependencies consumed from a remote registry, and the publishing of such modules (or words to that effect - I\u0027ll leave to @rogpeppe@gmail.com).\n\n(we need not include mention of it because we don\u0027t yet support them, but local directory-based replace directives will also mean that symlinks in the target module are also honoured).",
