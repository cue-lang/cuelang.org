# build.bash is used when deploying the CUE playground within the wider
# cuelang.org site. It will, therefore, be run with a working directory that is
# within the module cache. Given we need to run npm install etc, this will fail
# because in this context all files/directories are read-only. Hence we make a
# copy of "ourselves" to a temp directory, make that writable, then run through
# all our dist steps.
