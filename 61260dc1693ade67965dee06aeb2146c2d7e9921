This was forced by the generated nature of the pages and their associated aliases. I don\u0027t feel this is a problem (hence mentioning it here, not in the commit), as I don\u0027t imagine that folks had that page bookmarked instead of the the bare \"cue\" page, which *does* have a working alias.",
