      "message": "I think this first sentence needs to explain more simply what is going on here. I think as currently written it assumes that \"inject\" is clear, and also that \"values\". I would drop the part of the sentence \"across various situations and different `cue` subcommands\" and use that saved space for either rewording, or a second sentence to help with the explanation.\n\nAs explain below I don\u0027t think we need the caveat in the sentence \"All the techniques...\"",
