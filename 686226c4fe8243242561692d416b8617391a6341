      "message": "What does the `inline` prefix mean? I\u0027m finding a number of the special naming that you are trying to following hard to follow, almost like there is too much meaning/semantics you are trying to convey with them. \"inline\" is not explained anywhere on this page, and doesn\u0027t appear to have any meaning in the context of the examples being presented. Please can you make the names simpler, or explain what you were trying to convey?",
