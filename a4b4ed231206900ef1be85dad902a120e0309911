      "message": "I would massively shorten this, and inline the list you are taking the length of. \n\nSame for the `len()` of a string, but I would comment that with a warning about the fact that using `strings.MinRunes` and `strings.MaxRunes` instead because the byte length of a string is rarely what\u0027s intended. \n\nIndeed I would link to https://alpha.cuelang.org/docs/howto/constrain-the-length-of-a-string/.\n\nI\u0027ve never used `len()` on a struct, and I think I would go as far as to suggest it\u0027s an anti pattern in the same way that it is for strings. So I would not include that example.",
