For howto guides, that /generally/ means we go with something like\n\n    docs/howto: ensure an int is odd or even\n    \n... so that it reads naturally. This often aligns closely with the actual URL path the page inhabits, but doesn\u0027t need to match 100%.",

I\u0027ve been *highly* picky - but not because there\u0027s anything particularly egregious in your change, but because I\u0027m very conscious that *we\u0027ve* not yet written a style guide or similar for the site. My points reflect /our/ shortcomings, not yours!\n\nPlease do have a read of my notes, and I\u0027d love to hear about how you found the process of starting to write docs with the preprocessor.\n\nThanks again!\nJonathan",

The committed version of the file **must** be stable, so it\u0027s the same before and after the preprocessor handles it in CI.\n\nIn short, we don\u0027t leave those \"dev mustn\u0027t forget not to check in XYZ\" choices down to the user, so if the guide\u0027s CUE changes when `cue fmt`\u0027d, then that\u0027s a problem :-)\n\nI\u0027ve just tested, and my suspicion that this was a subtle \"bi-stable\" `cue fmt` situation was incorrect. Given that, I wonder if we should change to this form, which /looks/ superficially harmonised despite not really being formatted the same ...\n\n```\n#Even: num\u003d{2 * (__div(num, 2))}\n#Odd:  num\u003d{1 + 2*(__div(num, 2))}\n```",
