      "message": "Quite understandably, you followed the naming suggestion in cue-lang/docs-and-content#97, but for commit messages we tend to err on the side of shorter prefixes. For howto guides, that /generally/ means we go with something like\n\n    docs/howto: ensure an int is odd or even\n    \n... so that it reads naturally. This often aligns closely with the actual URL path the page inhabits, but doesn\u0027t need to match 100%.",

I\u0027ve been *highly* picky - but not because there\u0027s anything particularly egregious in your change, but because I\u0027m very conscious that *we\u0027ve* not yet written a style guide or similar for the site. My points reflect /our/ shortcomings, not yours!\n\nPlease do have a read of my notes, and I\u0027d love to hear about how you found the process of starting to write docs with the preprocessor.\n\nThanks again!\nJonathan",
