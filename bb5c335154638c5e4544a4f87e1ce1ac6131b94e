Doesn\u0027t have to be right now, just flagging the added HTTP redirect.\n\nSlight fix up:\n\ncuelang.org/go/cue/load\n-\u003e\ncuelang.org/golang/go.html?cue/load\n-\u003e\npkg.go.dev/cuelang.org/go/cue/load\n\nBut yes, two redirects. The first 302 redirect by Netlify to /golang/go.html is the one that captures /go/* and turns it into a query parameter. The result of that redirect must include the go-import meta tag. So this one can\u0027t be removed.\n\nThe second browser-only redirect is a convenience for users who happen to visit https://cuelang.org/go/cue/load and expect to end up on pkg.go.dev.\n\n\u003e One way would be to code generate one HTML file per Go package, like I did for mine. A similar way would be to do that via Hugo, like https://github.com/markdumay/hugo-theme-vanity.\n\nPossibly. It doesn\u0027t seem worth the effort to drop a single 302 redirect right now at least.",
