      "message": "So now there would be two redirects:\n\ncuelang.org/go/cue/load\n-\u003e\ncuelang.org/golang/go.html?go/cue/load\n-\u003e\npkg.go.dev/cuelang.org/go/cue/load\n\nWould be nice to avoid the first unnecessary redirect, as it will affect browser users as well as any `GOPROXY\u003ddirect go get` users. Doesn\u0027t have to be right now, just flagging the added HTTP redirect.\n\nOne way would be to code generate one HTML file per Go package, like I did for mine. A similar way would be to do that via Hugo, like https://github.com/markdumay/hugo-theme-vanity.",
