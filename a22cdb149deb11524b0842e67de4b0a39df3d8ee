      "message": "FYI a more principled approach might be https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath#Rel plus https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath#IsLocal - that is, `Rel(projectRoot, cwd)` should succeed and return a path that is considered as \"local\" by `IsLocal`, as in nothing like `/foo` or `../bar`.\n\nI imagine that in 99% of cases the result is the same, but in some edge cases it might not be, e.g. if either path is not properly cleaned, or there are symlinks. I think the Rel+IsLocal approach would better reflect what cmd/cue would do in terms of \"am I inside a module\", too.\n\nI realise we have this bit of code elsewhere already. I\u0027m only bringing this up now since IsLocal was added in Go 1.20 - before it existed, Rel alone wasn\u0027t really enough to answer \"is A underneath the directory at B\".",
