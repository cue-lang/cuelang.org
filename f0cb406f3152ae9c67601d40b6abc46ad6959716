      "message": "I added a CL before this one that hopefully makes it clearer what is going on in terms of the generated cache files. That change ends up creating a tiny bit more noise to update that test every time the preprocessor hash key changes, but it\u0027s probably worth it. That CL causes a further change in this CL which hopefully makes the effect of the change clearer.",
