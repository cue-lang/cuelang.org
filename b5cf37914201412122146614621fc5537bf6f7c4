      "message": "This is too vague to my mind. This paragraph is talking about \"conditional tests\" - can we not be precise that we are talking about an \"`if` comprehension\"? Is there a reason to not use that phrase?\n\nI think we can also briefly spell out the two ways of spelling an `if` comprehension that contains multiple conditions that must all hold: `if A \u0026\u0026 B` and `if A if B`. We can then explain that this howto explains how/when to use one vs the other. That way, the language is clear, and people are immediately clear on the reason to read on. The detail about not short-circuiting feels like it is a \"below the example\" explanation.",

      "message": "This seems a bit vague - I think we can more precise but that explanation probably sits below the example. The main driver for using chained `if` comprehensions is when the first condition can result in an error. Type checks are one such example, non-existent fields are another. Indeed I think checking for a non-existent field is probably clearer to most (citation required), because it\u0027s likely more common:\n\n```\nA: y: 5\n\nif A.x !\u003d _|_ if A.x \u003e 5 {\n  B: \"ok\"\n}\n```\n\nThen the below-the-example explanation can include a list of other situations that (like the type check) give rise to an error in case the first condition does _not_ short-circuit and the second condition is attempted.",
