      "message": "With reference back to the original user question/comment on this issue. This piece of content should I think focus on the difference between `if A if B` and `if A \u0026\u0026 B`. The multi vs single line point is I think far less significant (and could even be explained away in a comment rather than being spelt out). \n\nHence I think this needs an example that shows why the chained form is necessary over `\u0026\u0026`. Here is one such (bad) example:\n\n```\na: \"5\"\nif (a \u0026 int) !\u003d _|_ if a \u003e 2 {\n\tb: 4\n}\n```\n\nvs\n\n```\na: \"5\"\nif (a \u0026 int) !\u003d _|_ \u0026\u0026 a \u003e 2 {\n\tb: 4\n}\n```\n\nThe point being, CUE does not have short-circuit evaluation (for now, and it may never).",
