It\u0027s long been a bugbear of mine that Hugo\u0027s build command was the /absence/ of a sub-command, so I happily noticed the `build` option in the newer release\u0027s help text.\n\nI don\u0027t *believe* we use the bare `hugo` command anywhere else, and route all calls through the script that this CL updates. I can\u0027t be 100% sure, as the output of `git grep hugo` (or similar) is pretty unhelpful.\n\nI\u0027ll let you make any similar change to the preprocessor as needed/wanted.",
