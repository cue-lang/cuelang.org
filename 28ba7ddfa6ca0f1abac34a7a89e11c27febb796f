      "message": "\u003e Why do you use the `valid` field here, and not for the `invalid` fields?\n\nAs per my [comment below](https://review.gerrithub.io/c/cue-lang/cuelang.org/+/1174202/comment/a65bad02_8c860b2d/), I think we *generally* want the reader to see the guide\u0027s primary field validator applied in a form they could copy and paste, applied without templating hence fully comprehensible to the templating-**un**aware reader.\n\nHowever, as the relevant/applicable \"lesson\" in this guide is shown via the /failing/ validations, and I wanted to reduce repetition somewhat, I templated the less important constraint into `valid`.\n\nI intended the `valid` struct to act as a container that holds examples of things that the function will accept, but for the top-level /invalid/ fields to act as direct recipients of the validator (i.e. applied without templating), showing off the failure in the `cue` CLI error output. \n\nI\u0027m perfectly happy to make any/all the changes you suggested, but please reconsider if templating the guide\u0027s most pertinent examples would lead to the clearest lesson being transmitted to the beginning CUE user. I believe **not** using templating for the \"important\" examples (i.e. those producing errors) feels more new-user-friendly.\n\n\u003e The name of the field should indicate there is a problem (i.e. v4TooManyOctets) and be more benign when it will not contain an error (i.e. v4String).\n\n**Exactly** my thought process, too :-)",
