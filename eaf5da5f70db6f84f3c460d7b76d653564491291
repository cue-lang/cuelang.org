      "message": "I think we use it in one place that I\u0027ve seen (the community calendar), and I\u0027d internalised it as indicating a calendar **S**ubscription, based on the prose surrounding its use.\n\nI selected `/-/` so that `^/-` could be use as an access log filter, in a way which `^/s` couldn\u0027t. I know that `^/s/` could, but having something punctuation-based feels more clearly-not-a-content-page-y.\n\nI hold it lightly, but I do like \u0026 prefer the `/-/` prefix.",

I made it up, thinking about ways to make it clear that it\u0027s not a content page, and allowing for easier distinction from content pages when filtering traffic logs in the future. I also considered `/_/`, but felt that that alternative might well suffer from annoying terminal font-rendering problems and/or readability issues if we choose to use the prefix when creating clickable shortlinks from CLI help texts to site pages.",
