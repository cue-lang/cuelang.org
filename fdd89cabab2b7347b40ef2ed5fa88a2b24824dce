      "message": "Broadly there are plans, from most likely to happen soon to least likely, to have:\n* More data encodings: TOML, INI, etc\n* A common interface between encodings, so they can be combined or swapped more easily\n* Improved schema encoding and decoding, as e.g. OpenAPI currently has a number of bugs and limitations\n* Better support for generating CUE from code, e.g. a more powerful and customizable `cue get go`\n* Initial support for generating code from CUE to include its logic, like you mention here \n\nI\u0027m not sure how much you want to say here. I would personally not say too much, because we don\u0027t want to over-promise. For example, we currently only have milestoned work on the first two of those goals, the others might not happen until late in the year.",
