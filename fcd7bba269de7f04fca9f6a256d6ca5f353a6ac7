      "message": "This change isn\u0027t correct for a couple of reasons. Most importantly the order of iteration of a struct is not part of the spec yet, so not guaranteed. For a list it is guaranteed. And per https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/:\n\n\u003e The redirects engine will process the first matching rule it finds, reading from top to bottom.\n\nSecondly, it seems like a minor cosmetic improvement to define a key-value pair at the cost of being able to specify the options that might be needed for a redirect:\n\nhttps://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/redirect-options/\n\nFor example, we want some of these redirects to be 301, i.e. we\u0027ve now permanently moved a page.",
