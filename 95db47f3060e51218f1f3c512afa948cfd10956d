GOPROXY could still be obeyed and it\u0027s probably fine.\n\n`GOPROXY\u003ddirect` is what we currently use in CI which, whilst overkill, remains in place in this CL, hence needs to be unset (I /think/).\n\nAfter you pointed out the differing uses of `GONOPROXY` and `GONOSUMDB` I figured we can assume they\u0027re not being used for now, and we could evolve this script if they become relevant.",
